Any time my family and friends are in an altercation, I’m the one who steps in. I’m the one they call to fight for them. I do this even though I have a tough time trusting the people I’m fighting for.

Have you tried to talk about the subjects of the past, in the present at a time in which there is no heat between the two of you?Since your gf would like to resolve situations from the past the best way to do so would be to talk about them. The more you try to avoid certain subjects the more likely they will come up between you at worse possible moments.If you can get ahead of the pattern of old topics coming up without your control, then try scheduling a discussion about them. This by itself will show your gf you care about what she cares about and this may be one quality she would feel good about.

Are you facing any type of overwhelming situation in your waking life?Dreams and nightmares are the non-logical ways in which we make emotional sense of what goes on in our everyday waking world.Besides having some type of relaxing bedtime routine to set a peaceful mood for your sleep, and avoiding viewing violent films and video games as entertainment, maybe even avoiding news stories which sometimes have similar themes of violence, the content of our dreams and nightmares is out of our direct control.Your nightmares may offer useful clues as to what you're trying to resolve in your life. Pay attention to the story of your nightmare because it reflects how you feel in waking life.If you feel helpless and silenced in your nightmare, or taken advantage of, or whatever dreadful situation goes on during your nightmare, then look for where in waking life, you may feel similar.In this way, you'll become clearer about stressors in your life that you may not have realized existed were it not for the stress of nightmares.

From what you write, it sounds like you're reaching quite far into your child's father's way to handle his friendships.There's a difference between an agreement between you and the child's father to not view porn, and with you monitoring and setting standards for your child's father's way to handle his social life.Try to accept the limits of your request extends to you and the child's father, not the way the child's father wants to handle his relationships with other people.Also, pushing too hard or setting your expectations of the child's father too wide for him to tolerate may end up backfiring on you.Who knows, maybe he'll decide "enough is enough" and withdraw from the otherwise reasonable agreement to not watch porn.

I been having anger problems a lot lately. It only takes one word wrongly said to set me off. I use to not be like this until I got with my soon-to-be husband.
I'm glad you're okay.

We went out had great sex and I was really liking her. Then one day she says we should just be friends, but I can't stop thinking about her. She's always on mind and I want her back.
I think it's important to be open and honest with your partner about your feelings.

After first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?
I am a counselor and I am a counselor.
=====
In middle school and high school, my friends and family thought I was gay. I tried telling them, but they wouldn’t believe me. It almost feels like they wanted me to be.
I have a lot of issues that I need to address
=====
I have PTSD from childhood events and other traumas as an adult. I have panic attacks, nightmares, anger, and at times depression. I feel like I'm always on the edge or just apathetic.
I think that you are right. I have been working with people who have PTSD for years and have found that they are able to cope with the stress of the situation without resorting to violence.
=====
I have known I was always different. This year, in December, I found out that I never felt female. I did research and have identified myself as male but don't know how to tell my dad.
I have been in therapy for over a year and a half and have been able to change my life.
=====
After 40 years of being straight, how could I now find myself interested in people of the same sex? I have had a few same sex encounters of my own doing.
I am sorry you are experiencing this and I’m glad that you are looking for help and support.

I have known I was always different. This year, in December, I found out that I never felt female. I did research and have identified myself as male but don't know how to tell my dad.
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm not sure how to help you. I know you're struggling with your sexuality and you're not sure how to deal with it. You have a lot of questions about your sexuality and your feelings about it.
=====
I've recently thought that i could be transgender but I've never had the mind of a girl.
I know you are not transgender.

I've recently thought that i could be transgender but I've never had the mind of a girl.
What is your opinion on the subject of gender identity?
=====
My mom and dad got divorced four years ago. I had to finish out the school year with my dad, and now they are deciding which place is best for me. I can't choose.
I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but you are a parent.
=====
My mom is always bossy and treats me like a child even though I'm in my 20s. She argues with me over stupid stuff.
I'm not sure if you are aware of the fact that your mother is a doctor.
=====
We're in an eight year relationship. My boyfriend drinks a lot. He experienced childhood trauma.
You are right.
=====
I had a dispute with my therapist regarding an appointment cancellation. Now, she is blocking me from seeing other psychologists at the same clinic (which takes my insurance), which is also where I get my psychiatric services. There is a strict 48 hour cancellation policy, and my appointments are at 3:00 on Tuesday.
I would encourage you to seek out a therapist who is trauma-informed or a trauma therapist who has knowledge about sexual concerns. Even consensual sex can be experienced as an intrusion if a partner was not careful or insensitive to your pain. It would be normal to have some difficulties with sex after such an incident.
=====
I've been with my partner for 4 years. She's given me no reason not to trust her. But lately I've been overreacting a lot when she's just doing normal things.
I would encourage you to seek out a therapist who can work with you slowly and at your pace.
=====
My parents seem okay with other sexualities, but normally they only talk about being gay. When they do talk about bisexuality, they say things like “they'll do anything” or things that make me very uncomfortable because I am bisexual. I don't know if I am ready to come out to them.
I am not ready to come out to my parents.
=====
My roommate is a unapologetic person who doesn't care who she hurts. She never apologizes to me or my family. She made me lose my temper today to the point where I was using swear words in front of my mom and brother.
I'm sorry to hear that this has happened. Counselors are legally and ethically required to make sure that they always put the wellbeing of their clients above their own interests. In addition, counselor ethical rules, and the laws in just about every state, make it illegal for counselors to take advantage of a client financially.
=====
I was raped a couple months ago, Since then, along with other unfortunately events that have occurred, I have been having trouble feeling emotions. It's almost as if I'm a sociopath lacking any feeling. What can I do to change this?
I think you are right.
=====
The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.
I'm not sure if you are aware of this, but you are not allowed to have a doctor's appointment with your child.
=====
I snap easy and push people away. I need help before I push my boyfriend away.
I have been in a relationship with a guy for about a year now.
=====
My long-term girlfriend broke up with me recently. She says it's because of my anger.
I'm sorry, but I don't think that's the case either. I think she's just angry because she doesn't want to be with you anymore.
=====
I'm in my mid-twenties now, and my boyfriend of seven years and I want to start a life. My mother is 100% codependent on me and is extremely manipulative. She suffers from type 1 diabetes, which she uses to guilt me if I ever leave her.
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm glad you're taking the time to talk to someone about this. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and concerns.
=====
My issue isn't resisting angry urges; it's the anger itself. My rage is extreme and vastly disproportionate to the direct stressor. It causes violent thoughts, but I never act.
I'm not sure what to do.
=====
She is living with her boyfriend of seven years. He is in therapy for depression and social anxiety. He hasn't worked in all this time.
I would say that the client is more difficult because she is living with her boyfriend.
=====
I met this girl in high school. She had switched schools at the end of the year, and I have not seen her since. It's been a few years.
I think you are experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety
=====
I think I have depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and I have anger issues. I told my mom over and over again. She told me she would get me a therapist, but she never did.
I think you are letting fear get a hold on you! You would really enjoy some sexual activities that your wife hasn't initiated in a long while, but it's a big leap to go from that to "I married the wrong person". Fear is telling you that she doesn't respect or like or want you?
=====
What do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parent's custody visitation?
I am not sure what to do.
=====
I have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences. Not a year ago, I had a car accident. Could this experience add more problems?
I would like to say that you are not alone in your struggles.
=====
I have major depression, severe, PTSD, anxiety disorder, and personality disorder. I had an appointment with my doctor. I was very upset, and I shared with him about that particular drug.
I have been with my boyfriend for about a year.

How does a person start the counseling process?
Then I ask myself

I have major depression, severe, PTSD, anxiety disorder, and personality disorder. I had an appointment with my doctor. I was very upset, and I shared with him about that particular drug.
I'm sorry for your concern.

I'm a female freshman in high school, and this question is for my male best friend. At the start of freshman year, we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date. He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two.
I think it's important to understand that you are not alone in your feelings.
=====
I've been hurt by a man for five years. He doesn't involve me with the family or kids. Everyone in the family is against me.
I'm sorry to hear that.
=====
Whenever I sing along with a song that I like (even if it's just for the beat and not the lyrics), my boyfriend assumes that the words of the song mean something negative about our realationship. I don't why he gets so mad and assumes I mean something negative from every song. Now I can't enjoy and sing a song without him thinking I'm trying to give him a hint.
I think you're right.
