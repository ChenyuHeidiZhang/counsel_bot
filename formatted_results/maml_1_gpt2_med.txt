We just cannot seem to get along. I cannot have a conversation with her without it turning into World War 3. She treats me like I have no right to an opinion and never really lets me speak.
I'm not sure if that's true, but I think that's probably why you're having problems with her.
=====
I was a victim of an incident. I've been made fun of and have been beating myself up for it because I don't feel anyone honestly believes me. There are so many other factors I deal with on a daily basis.
I'm sorry, but I don't think that's true.
=====
I have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences. Not a year ago, I had a car accident. Could this experience add more problems?
I'm not sure.
=====
Everyone around me is much smarter and flaunts it. Everyone around me is skinny, and here I am trying to throw up so I'm not fat. Everything I do is wrong, and I can't seem to do anything right!
I'm not sure if that's true, but I think that's probably true.

I'm a male in my 20s. My girlfriend is in her late 30s. She's great.
I'm a female in my 20s. My girlfriend is in her late 30s.
=====
I'm fine when we start becoming intimate, but out of nowhere, I will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past. I start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me.
I'm sorry, but that's not how it works.
=====
I like getting attention from men. I don't have sex. I lead them on to thinking I might want to.
I'm not sure how to respond to that.
=====
My mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back, and I can't seem to forgive her. I want to say that it's okay, but I can't. I feel like even if I did forgive her, I wouldn't be able to say it to her face.
I'm sorry that you feel that way about your mom.

I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.

I'm sorry, but I'm not going to talk about that.

I was raped a couple months ago, Since then, along with other unfortunately events that have occurred, I have been having trouble feeling emotions. It's almost as if I'm a sociopath lacking any feeling. What can I do to change this?

I'm not sure.
