I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.

I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?
It's understandable to feel a lot of fear around starting therapy, but it's not something to worry about. It's normal to feel anxious before starting a new process, but it will pass. Try to relax and focus on the task at hand- learning more about your feelings and how to deal with them.

In particular during family gatherings (such as funerals), where there are different customs.
Thanks for bringing this up. It's important to be aware of and respect other people's cultures. However, it's also important to express your feelings and needs in a way that is respectful to the person you are talking to. For example, instead of saying "Can you please stop doing that?" say "I find it difficult to listen to you when you do that." This gives the person the opportunity to explain their actions instead of getting defensive.

My fiancé and I recently had an argument over finances. He gives me the money each month to pay his automobile insurance. He no longer has one of the vehicles on the policy. He realized he was still paying for the coverage and asked why I was allowing him to continue to do that since I was physically paying it for him. My response was that he was giving me the money, and I just made the payment.
Hello, I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling so upset and frustrated. Can you tell me more about what happened, specifically? Was there an argument about the money, or was there some other issue? If there was an argument, what was said? If there was some other issue, can you give me some more information?

I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.
Thank you for sharing this with me. I'm sorry to hear that you experienced this and that it made you feel embarrassed. This kind of thing should never happen and I'm glad you brought it to my attention. From what you've told me, it sounds like this boy may have been trying to make a sexual comment.

I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?
Yes, it is normal to feel a lot of anxiety and fear when you first enter therapy. This is because you are opening up and revealing a lot of yourself to someone who you may not feel comfortable with. It is also natural for you to feel some apprehension about the future as you embark on this journey. It is important to remember that therapy is a process and that it will get better over time. You should also keep in mind that therapy is not a one time event. You should come back to see us on a regular basis as this will help you maintain progress.

About 5 months ago my ex left without fully explaining why. For me it seemed out of the blue. I don't miss her as much as I used to but I just don't trust people anymore, not even my friends who I have known since my childhood not even my family. I'm so terrified of being judged or dismissed. Instead of acting like someone else or putting on a mask of a personality, I've just shut down.
It is natural to feel scared and overwhelmed after a breakup. It is also normal to feel like you are on your own and that no one understands what you are going through. I would encourage you to reach out to a support group or counseling to help you through this difficult time.

My fiancé and I have almost the best relationship every girl wants, but lately it's changed. I get less attention and little to no intercourse. He works a lot and goes to the gym a lot (he's a football player for an indoor league), but he has no time for me. We live two hours from family, and when I leave home to see family, he'll text me saying "whatever" and "leave me alone." But when we're together, everything is okay.
It sounds like you are feeling neglected and like you are not being given the attention that you need. This can be a very difficult feeling to deal with especially when it's not new and you have been in a good relationship for some time. It can be helpful to talk about what you are feeling with your fiancé. If he is not able to meet your needs, it may be helpful to talk to someone about what you can do to better accommodate his needs. A counselor could be a good resource for you.

I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?
It is normal to feel anxious when you first come to therapy. It can take time for you to feel more at ease. If you are still feeling this way after a few sessions, I would suggest that you consider another therapist.

My therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here. However, my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends. I have loaned money to him many times, and he always paid me back. I had a medical emergency last weekend and I was heavily medicated. I knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me, but this therapist dropped me off and never came again.
If you feel uncomfortable or unsafe with this therapist, please speak up. It sounds like you have put a lot of trust in him and it is important that you feel like you can trust your instincts. If something feels wrong, it is important to reach out for help.

It sounds like you are struggling with a lot of anger and frustration. It's important to remember that it's okay to have these feelings, but it's also important to express them in a healthy way.

However, some things to consider when looking for a therapist include whether they have experience working with your specific issue(s), whether they are licensed and insured, and whether they have a valid license to practice in your state.

Additionally, it is always helpful to document your thoughts and feelings about therapy in order to have a reference point when discussing your therapy with your therapist.

For some reason I feel very uncomfortable with my girlfriend showing off her body in certain poses on social media. I know she is proud of her body and I respect that, but I dont feel comfortable with her openly showing off her body the way she does. Anytime I bring it up to her she thinks Im calling her a whore.

It sounds like you are concerned about your girlfriend's feelings and you don't want to hurt her feelings. Unfortunately, it is not up to you to censor or control what your girlfriend posts online.

The past always feels much brighter and more beautiful than my present. Everything about what's gone feels so amazing; almost like I'm high off nostalgia. But in the end it just makes me feel sadder knowing that all of the memories (and a close friend that left me) are gone forever. How do I move past that and live more in the present?
This is a difficult question. It's hard to say precisely what you need to do to move on, but it's important to keep in mind that life doesn't end with the past. The memories of the past are important, but they shouldn't dictate your present or future. You should focus on living in the present and making the most of the present.

I loved him more than anything. He passed away on our anniversary which was also the day I was going to apply for our apartment. I'm not handling it well. I moved to a new town and started a new life but nothing helps.
This is a heartbreaking situation and one that I know all too well. When someone we love dies, it feels like our world is torn apart. This is also a time when we feel the most alone and lost. It's often difficult to find our way and to cope with the changes that have taken place. Often, we feel as though our loved one has abandoned us. And in a lot of cases, that's exactly what happens. Especially when we're in the midst of the grieving process. One of the things I would encourage you to do is to find a support system of friends or family members who can offer you a listening ear, an understanding smile, and just a touch of compassion. They may not be able to give you the answer to your question about why your partner died, but they can offer you a place to start to heal.

I'm a young adult woman, and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home. This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why.
It sounds like you might be struggling with guilt and shame because you allowed yourself to become sexually involved with your boyfriend when you knew you weren't ready. Maybe you thought it was okay because you were dating and you weren't really having sex with him. Guilt and shame can be really tough to deal with, but it's important to remember that you didn't do anything wrong. You were a victim too.

I’m in a relationship with my child's father. I’m a really jealous person. We don’t go out or do anything with other people because of me. To keep our relationship going, I know I have to stop being jealous, but I can’t. How can I get over these issues?
It sounds like your jealousy is preventing you from being in a relationship with someone else. It's important to remember that jealousy is a normal human emotion. But it's important to learn how to control it.Jealousy can be overcome by understanding and accepting that other people are separate from you.You can do this by practicing mindfulness.

In particular during family gatherings (such as funerals), where there are different customs.
Family gatherings can be really hard. They're a time where we're all supposed to be together and support each other, but sometimes it's hard to do that when there are different customs. For example, in some cultures, it's common to kiss the family members after they die. That might not be something you're comfortable with, and that's okay. You don't have to do it. It's okay to say that you don't want to, and that you want to avoid that part of the gathering.

I'm a Christian teenage girl, and I have lost my virginity. My boyfriend is a Christian teenager too, but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner. I planned to abstain from sex but I guess I wasn't clear about this because I was also tempted and led him on. We continued to have sex. Does it mean that he isn't the one God planned for me?
Hi! This is a great question.When you lose your virginity, it's not just about the physical act of intercourse. It's also about the emotional connection you form with that person. In this case, because you were both Christian teenagers, you were probably seeking to form an emotional connection with your partner.However, because this was not consensual and you were not clear about your intentions, it could lead to feelings of guilt, shame, and betrayal.Right now, it is important for you to take some time to process all of this. You may want to talk to a trusted friend or counselor who can offer you support and guidance.

I snap easy and push people away. I need help before I push my boyfriend away.
If you're feeling like you're snapping or pushing people away, it's probably not a good idea to keep doing that.

It might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you figure out what's going on and find some ways to deal with the stress or anxiety. If you're worried about harming your boyfriend, you might want to reach out to him and tell him what's going on. He might be able to provide some support or talk to you about ways to deal with the stress or anxiety.

My fiancée is always letting me know how I am a horrible/evil person, or I just don’t care enough when it’s about her feeling or when she is having an off day.
From the tone of your letter it seems like your fiancée is using words like 'horrible' and 'evil' to distance herself from you.

My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the "straight and narrow" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin.

I just wanted to get to know one so I can hear about their college experience and the courses they took. I also wanted to know if they enjoy their job and how long they were in school.
There are a few things going on with this question. One is that you may be interested in this person for other reasons than getting to know them. You may be thinking about what they look like, what they're like on a personal level, and how you might be able to use them. You also may be wondering how much you can trust them or how much information you can get from them. When we are interested in someone, it can be hard to put those thoughts and desires aside and focus on the person in front of us.

He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others. His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?
First, it sounds like your fiancé is very defensive of his feelings and is holding onto your past as if it were a badge of honor. That is not healthy for either of you.

I love him so much, and I don't know what to do.
It's so hard when you love someone and they don't love you back. At first, you may feel like you are doing everything wrong. But the truth is, if your loved one isn't in a position to love you back, then there is nothing that you can do to make them change. The only thing that you can do is accept that this is how things are and focus on your own happiness. You deserve to be happy and loved, even if your loved one isn't capable of providing that for you.

The past always feels much brighter and more beautiful than my present. Everything about what's gone feels so amazing; almost like I'm high off nostalgia. But in the end it just makes me feel sadder knowing that all of the memories (and a close friend that left me) are gone forever. How do I move past that and live more in the present?
It's really difficult when we're faced with difficult memories or experiences. We often revert to our old ways in order to cope. This can manifest as living in the past, or dwelling on the negative aspects of the past. Living in the present is really important in order to move forward. You can start by trying to find something that brings you joy in the present. Doing things you love, spending time with loved ones, or simply being outdoors can help.

There is no one "right" therapist for any individual. Every person's needs are different, and the best way to find a therapist who is right for you is by talking to them and getting a feel for what they are capable of providing. In addition, you can try to "train" your therapist by getting clear about what you would like to get out of treatment and what you are willing to do to make that happen. This can include things like discussing your goals, brainstorming ideas about how to reach those goals, and setting realistic expectations for how much progress you want to make in a given session.

I had found out about a month before, but I hadn't told him I knew because I didn't want us to break up.

Whenever I run into a situation that makes me upset or angry, I tend to start cursing and badly offending the person I am confronting. I say mean things to let my anger out. Whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship (like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship) I lash out not just them but at my boyfriend. I feel like I keep causing drama due to my personality. I want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful.
It sounds like you are struggling with managing your emotions. It is very common for people to react in ways that are destructive when they are angry or upset. People often lash out at those closest to them because it is a way of self-protection. It is also very difficult to control our impulses and we may feel like we have no choice. In order to manage your anger more effectively, I suggest that you try to identify the triggers for your anger. Once you know what sets off your anger, you can begin to try and avoid those situations. Additionally, you may want to consider therapy or counseling to help you learn how to manage your anger and emotions.

It is important for you to understand that you are not responsible for what happened and that you did not do anything wrong.

My fiancé and I have almost the best relationship every girl wants, but lately it's changed. I get less attention and little to no intercourse. He works a lot and goes to the gym a lot (he's a football player for an indoor league), but he has no time for me. We live two hours from family, and when I leave home to see family, he'll text me saying "whatever" and "leave me alone." But when we're together, everything is okay.
From what you are saying, it sounds like something is causing the relationship to change. It may be something as simple as time away from each other, or it could be something more serious. If you can't identify what the issue is, I would recommend talking to your fiancé about it. It sounds like he is important to you, and it would be nice to know what is causing the relationship to change.

My grandma and brother both passed away 11 years ago and sometimes at night I just can't stop crying while thinking about the good memories we had but won't have ever again.

Sometime when small thing happen, like losing a comb, I get furious. I even start throwing things. Do I have a problem?
I don't believe so. It sounds like you are reacting to the stress of the situation rather than the situation itself. I would recommend trying to identify the source of the stress, and dealing with it head on. For example, if you're having trouble with finances, see if you can talk to a financial advisor, or if you're struggling with a relationship, try to reach out to a support group.

What am I doing wrong? My wife and I are fighting all the time. What can I do? We don't agree on anything and she usually jumps to conclusions, which are usually wrong on how I feel. She is very family-oriented while all of my family left me on my butt, abused, ignored and messed up with me mentally.
Your wife is trying to do what she believes is best for you. Your family left you, and she's trying to take care of you. This is a difficult situation, but it's important to remember that your wife loves you. Even when you're fighting, she still cares about you. Take some time for yourself and clear your head so that you can be more understanding and responsive to your wife.

My issue isn't resisting angry urges; it's the anger itself. My rage is extreme and vastly disproportionate to the direct stressor. It causes violent thoughts, but I never act. I stay lucid enough to know the rage is violent, not me. I don't want to drown myself in anger and resentment.
