I’ve been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for just over a year. This past week she admitted to me that she has feelings for another guy. She says it’s “just a crush” but I don't know how to cope with it. How should I deal with this?
While difficult, a long distance relationship can provide some difficulties as well. I have to say that many people have been in a long distance relationship and they were not loving at all.Your girlfriend has a crush and she is in the process of knowing what she wants.In the meantime, she wants to be with you.What do you want?Stay true to your wishes and give her space.Do not try to persuade her to come back.Give her time to understand what she wants, who she is and what she is looking for in a relationship.Do not try to rush her.Wait and see how she is doing and if she wants to work on the relationship.From what you write, it sounds as if you care a great deal about her and it is obvious that you are very much in love with her.Trust that she is having her own process and give her time.There is always hope that she will come back.Sending lots of caring energy your way!

I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.
"A lot of times the past holds on to us and we are not completely able to release it. The good news is that we can release it. Releasing is different than denying. Releasing means it is out of your system and you are moving forward. Denial means you are not facing the issue but you are avoiding it. Avoidance is a sign of fear, but fear doesn't have to control you. You can be at peace with your past and move forward into your present and future. You are not a prisoner to your past. With the right tools you can move forward, have peace and build a brighter future. I highly recommend seeking the guidance of a professional therapist. Most places offer free consultation and that is a great time to get all your questions answered. Good luck, you can do this!

"I'm in my early 20s, and I've been seeing my boyfriend for a year now. My boyfriend has always been the sweetest guy until recently. He has made comments such as “you would look better as a Tumblr girl"" or ""you should start doing more squats."" It's really hurtful."
It is never okay to make comments that are hurtful.

I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?
I think it is perfectly normal to feel a little nervous when you go to counseling. Many people feel a lot of anxiety when they go to talk to someone they don't know. Therapy is an opportunity to talk about things that might be difficult to talk about with a stranger. If you feel comfortable with your therapist and things have gone well in the past I wouldn't see it as a problem. However, if you feel like you aren't getting through to your therapist or that you aren't feeling comfortable you might want to find a therapist you do feel comfortable with. This can make a big difference. It can help you to be more open and share your concerns. I hope this was helpful. I wish you the best of luck!

There are issues from my past that have me very heavily burdened in my heart. I've been torn for so many years and I need help so I can move on with my life. I experienced trauma when I was 8 years old and I did come out about it until I was 40. Now I know this is what's holding me back on my happiness. I've met a very loving and caring man but because I'm holding on to these things from my past I’m pushing him away. How can I get my life back?
As much as I want to say in this answer that there is a simple solution that you just need to do, it doesn't work like that.

My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.

This way you will know that you did the right thing. If you decide to start over, you'll be clear as to what you are willing to offer another person.If you were happy, then congratulations on knowing your own happiness. You handled the breakup in a clear and decisive way.Hopefully you'll find a new partner who feels the same way you do!I wish you the best! ¿Cómo debería de haber hecho?

I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.  I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.
It's very common for parents to misunderstand and not to 'get' what their kids are saying, because we don't get your language. People need to be educated that LGBTQQ people exist, and there is more to your life than what you have experienced with your parents. The best thing you can do for yourself is seek out a local therapist who specializes in working with LGBTQ issues, and share with your therapist what you are going through. You can trust your therapist to know how best to guide you. You may not want to trust your parents, but at least you can trust a person who has your best interests at heart. I hope that you find the support you need. And that your parents will come to understand what it is like to be undervalued and misunderstood by those they care most about.

Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out. How can I stop these thoughts?
"Hello, and thank you for your question. I have had many people ask me this over the years, and the answer is not simple, because it is a dynamic interaction between thoughts and our belief system. The ""scary thought"" is a thought in your mind that scares you. It could be something that you have seen in the media, on the street, or even something that you have read on the internet. What happens is that when we have an emotion that scares us, our mind has several automatic responses that happen to try and deal with the emotion. Sometimes these responses are things that we ""just don't want to deal with,"" but unfortunately we have to (it's how the human brain works). But here's the thing...we don't really want those things. We really want the emotion to stop, but our brain has not taught us how to stop these automatic responses, so we don't know how to stop them. We can, however, stop them from having power over us. So how do we stop the response? What if we stopped the response and replaced it with something else? You might be asking yourself what you could replace that response with. Your brain knows what it is telling you. It is telling you that the scary thought is a fact, and that ""fact"" is going to happen, so you better believe it!

I'm a teenager. My dad has been jail for the last five years. It's tough, but my mom really tries to give a normal life to my two sisters, my brother, and I. I feel like I took upon a parent role when I'm the second youngest, and I'm not stable. My mother and sisters say I'm overdramatic. I’m just so hurt, and I keep breaking down.
What has been helpful for you is to communicate your feelings to someone that you trust. This could be a friend, family member, or another adult. If you can find someone that you can talk to about your feelings, it will make it easier for you to express yourself. Although your feelings are tough to experience, being able to talk about them with someone that you trust will help relieve some of the burden. Keep in mind that you may feel a lot of things during this time. It is normal to feel sadness, loneliness, anger, and a lot of other things that you may experience. You may even feel a lot of different emotions at the same time. The best thing you can do is express yourself and keep track of your feelings. It is important to have a record of your emotions so that you can track your emotions as they come and go. This way, you can be aware of what is happening and learn to accept yourself. Remember that you are not alone and that there are a lot of people out there that are feeling the same way that you are feeling. We all experience tough emotions at times and it is okay to talk about how we feel. Now that you have expressed yourself, it is time to reflect and learn from your experiences and how you are feeling. Reflecting on what you learned from the experience can help you cope with your situation. If you learned anything from your experience, you will have a better idea of what to do next time that you may encounter a similar situation. For example, if you learned that you could not handle a situation and it made you feel sad, you could learn to take time to cope with your emotions by talking to someone you trust or by doing something that you enjoy. Although you may be feeling a lot of different emotions, learning to cope with those emotions and accept yourself can help you in the long run. I suggest that you consider seeing a counselor so that you can begin to cope with these emotions in a healthy way. A counselor can provide you with resources and help you learn coping skills that will allow you to deal with your emotions in a healthy and productive way. A counselor can also provide a safe environment for you to discuss your feelings. Remember that it is okay to feel how you feel and that you are not alone. Remember that learning to cope with your emotions is a process.

"My boyfriend and I have been together for five years now. Throughout the entire first day that we met, he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. That same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom's acknowledgment) and we kissed. The next two days were a repetition of the first day. On the third night, my mother finally caught us, and I was kicked out of my house. I left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. It was very hard for us. His stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot. Our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. After that, it was a downward spiral. We were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. We kept having the famous ""you're doing it wrong—do it this way"" argument. After six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. One afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. He told me to let him leave or he would hit me. He had once promised he would never touch me, so I challenged him to do it. He slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. I haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. I don't live with him, I don't depend on him, and we don't have children. We both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. He always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. Now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how I don't ever make the effort to try to be okay. I've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. I know he has to change that on his own. I just want to know if there's people who have gone through this and had the tables turned? Is there hope for a better future together?"
"Definitely there is hope for a better future together. Why don't you go to a domestic violence shelter and take some classes?

"Hi Seattle, I can tell you feel bad about exposing yourself in front of your classmates and I agree that it was embarrassing. When you've got a hard-on, your whole body says ""Look at me!"" You're not the only one who's hard. Especially in public. It's a primal thing, and embarrassing as it was, it was perfectly normal. If we didn't have hard-ons all the time, we'd have to cover them up. I'm an avid swimmer, and I know that people don't tend to wear swimsuits in the pool at the Y in downtown Seattle. People are getting naked. Naked. Every day. In the pool. Of course we're going to get hard. People are naked. In the pool. All the time.

I'm a teenage girl, and my dad is an alcoholic. I hate being at home with him because he just stresses me out. He can be picking me up from basketball practice or piano lessons, and half of the time, I don't even know if he's sober or not. I refuse to get into the vehicle with him and walk home sometimes. I've either been barely sleeping or I over sleep, so I'm always tired. I live in a small town, so there's no one I can really talk to because I'm not really that close with my family.
"Hi Kansas,I'm sorry to hear about your situation. It seems like you have many options of where to go, but you mention that you're not close to your family, so that leaves out some people. Is there anyone you can talk to? It's important to find someone you can trust and confide in. If you are not close with your family, maybe you can find a friend or a family member who lives in another city. Having a teenaged friend who you can talk to might be helpful. That's because they are often less likely to judge you if you say you can't talk to a family member. But you could also talk to a school counsellor, teacher, or a social worker. I hope you find a place to go. It sounds like you have a problem that you can't fix by yourself, but there are people who can help. Good luck!

I'm having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her. How can I learn how to listen and get myself together?
"The problem with listening is that most people don't really know how to do it. They may know what they want to say, but they don't know how to say it in a way that will make sense to the other person and which will trigger what they need to hear. A good teacher is always needed.Since you are the one having the problem, I'm going to assume that the person you're trying to help is the one who is doing something that is not very good for your relationship. If this is the case, you may be able to help your girlfriend by identifying what her bad behavior is. If you're able to tell her something that she wants to hear, but doesn't know how to say, then you can at least point out to her that there is a difference between good listening and bad listening.I would not recommend that you try and teach her how to listen. Try and get her the help she needs first. Good luck."Mental health is not a sign of weakness."If you are struggling with depression, for example, talk to your doctor or a counselor.

It is possible that what she is doing is her way of communicating to you that she wants to end the relationship.

We are stuck with who we are and can't change who we love. However, you can learn new ways to respond to her. If you don't want to change, then don't change. If you do want to change, then you need to find a way that feels good to you."It's more important to understand yourself than her."If you have been together for a while, then I might suggest that this particular problem may be showing up more often because you haven't quite figured out what you want.

My boyfriend and I have a terrible sex life after three years of dating, and I don't know what to do. I have this lingering fear of pain during sex after having two partners previously who weren't careful. How can I stop projecting this onto my current boyfriend?
Hi, I'm sorry this is happening to you. I would think about what in your past relationships contributes to this fear. You may be feeling that you can't trust this person to be gentle, or you may feel your past partners were not really into you. You may want to explore these ideas with a therapist. One thing I would try is to have sex without a condom. Use a diaphragm if you have one. That way, if it does hurt a bit, you will know it is your body's response and not fear. This fear can really affect your desire to have sex, so making yourself approachable to your own body can help. Also, being able to talk about what you like and don't like during sex can help with this. All of this sounds more complicated than I have here, but it can help to have a therapist help you explore this further. Good luck!

He's lied about his past/present situations. Since time has passed, he has changed, but I still have my doubts. I have no idea if I should stay or go, but I hate this feeling. I don't trust him all too much, but yet he hasn't done anything for me not to trust him recently.
Trust is essential for any relationship and if you do not trust your partner this may be a strong reason to end the relationship.There are ways to increase your trust in your partner.You can ask questions about his past and present life to find out more about him.If you feel hesitant about trusting him, then tell him what you expect of him in terms of trust.If he does not meet your expectations, then you can end the relationship.If he does meet your expectations, then you will have more trust in the relationship.Ask yourself why you are hesitant to trust him and what you expect from him to increase your trust in him.Maybe you expect that he would cheat on you or tell you something that may be untrue.Without knowing your reasons, then it is difficult to tell you what to do.Do you want to stay in the relationship or not?This is your decision and only you can know if staying in the relationship is right for you and your partner.Start by having open discussions with your partner about your feelings and expectations. With this, you will feel more secure in your partner and your feelings of trust. You may also decide together to either stay together or not. This discussion may feel difficult or even stressful at first. You will both learn more about each other and your relationship by having these discussions. This is not easy, but it is necessary. With these discussions and learning more about each other, then you will have a better sense of trust in the relationship.Warm wishes to both of you!

I was never single, afraid to be alone, and I looked for my boyfriend to make me happy. I finally worked on my self, was in a relationship, and I did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didn't work out. Now months later, no man peaks my interest. Am I ready to date again? Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?
"Hi Seattle, The most important thing is to accept that relationships and love just doesn't work out all the time. It's okay to be heartbroken and to grieve the loss. You may have outgrown the relationships in your past. I'm sure you can understand that now that you've had time to see the bad parts of relationships and heal from the wounds.I agree that it's possible that no man peaked your interest because there were no ""spark"". Maybe you weren't ready to date again. It's also possible that you're over a year out of the relationship, and if you date someone new again, you'll go through all the painful memories again, and it will be too much.I'm impressed with how much you've changed and that you've worked on your self. I'm not sure what you mean when you say you ""looked for a boyfriend to make me happy"", but you may have been looking for someone who wasn't going to make you happy. If you're not happy and he's not good for you, you're going to end up heartbroken. It's good that you're not afraid to be alone now. It's true that we can get used to being alone and can start missing the companionship and love. Try not to look for a boyfriend too quickly. If you're not ready to date and you're not really missing dating, maybe you're in the right place right now.I agree that if you're in a place where no one sparks your interest and you're not ready to date again, it's okay to hold off. You're a smart, mature woman. Give yourself permission to be in the place where you are right now. You're healing. You're ready. We're all in this place at different stages in our lives.I wish you the best.""Love is just a four-letter word.""The one who does not love does not hurt, nor does the one who is hurting.""Be careful about reading meaning into love!

"Can a counselor take sides with one parent and allow a parent to order the child to tell the counselor ""every detail"" about what happened during the other parent’s visitation in order to help build a case for child custody?"
I don't think a therapist would take sides with a parent and allow them to order the child to tell the therapist ""every detail"" about what happened during the other parent's visitation. I do think that a therapist would encourage the child to speak to them if they felt it would help in the child's healing process. In fact, the therapist might even suggest that the child do so.As a general rule, therapists do not participate in custody proceedings. In order to be able to provide the best support and care to a child, a therapist should not be getting involved in the process in any way. Even if the therapist was asked to assist in court proceedings, they would still be bound by the Code of Ethics and refuse to act in a way that conflicted with their Code of Ethics. If a child is being abused, a therapist may become involved in helping to protect the child from further harm, regardless of who the alleged perpetrator is. This is especially important if the therapist has any concerns about the competence of one parent in caring for the child. I'm not saying that this would be the case here, but I think it's worth noting that a therapist could intervene in this situation.I'm not sure how this question is being asked, but it seems like there are some other aspects that need to be considered as well. I wonder what your questions are?

I feel angry, anxious, and depressed. The PTSD I suffer is from a past relationship.
"I agree with the other answers here, and will add one thing: One of the best ways to work with any traumatic or traumatic experiences that you have had is through meditation. In meditation, you sit with the discomfort of a traumatic experience and allow it to be present with you, but not overwhelming you. Then, you learn to observe the experiences and sensations as if you were an outside observer, detached from the experience. You would be able to do this through meditation. Once you learn to be an outside observer, you can then work on your feelings about the event and what you are going through now. Even if you have no memory of the traumatic experience, the distress of it can affect you in many ways. And, now, if you have never dealt with that event directly, your brain is likely to ""react"" to that experience in the future by reminding you of it in future situations. In order for this to be resolved, you need to be able to bring awareness to the event and understand it on an emotional level, which allows you to have a new understanding of what it meant to you, and helps you feel more at ease. The result of this would be a sense of peace. I would recommend a trauma therapist who uses mindfulness and exposure therapy to help with this. Best of luck!

For example, she gets offended when I call someone at work ""sweetheart."" I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her. She doesn't, and never will say she was wrong. How do I get her to understand?"
"For many people, a discussion about sensitive topics can make the atmosphere feel more tense and emotional. The best way I've found to reduce the intensity of this type of discussion is to have it when you both are feeling calm. I suggest having a discussion when you're both not angry but also not feeling neutral. If you're feeling frustrated, then you're likely to be more emotional and reactive. You can have these discussions when both of you are at work or out with your families. It's best to have the discussion when you have a calm time where you can just focus on what you want to discuss. Going to a counselor will allow you to have the discussion with a neutral person who can help you identify your needs and her needs. You can help her understand your experience and she can explain hers. This will help you understand each other better and minimize the risk of the discussion escalating."I hope this helps. :-)"Carmen Rodriguez, LMHCP, LMCC"I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her."I don't, and never will say she was wrong."How do I get her to understand?

When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much. I’m afraid it’s going to break her. I don't know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.
I'm sorry that you are going through this. You may be right, it is not normal for your daughter to be stressing out so much. I think the best thing you can do is to sit down with your daughter and let her know that you see that she is stressed out and you want to help her. You can tell her that you believe she is working really hard and that it is not normal for her to be stressing out like this. Then you can offer to do things for her to help her. I would recommend that you get in contact with a counselor or therapist that can help both of you. This is not something that you can do on your own. If your daughter is not comfortable with you contacting a counselor, that is ok. You can either try to find a counselor that you can talk to, or you can find a therapist on the phone and try them out for a week or two. If you don't like it, try someone else. If your daughter does not want to talk to you or is not comfortable with you trying to help her, you can always try to find a counselor that can help her. They may be able to do things that you can't do or won't do. I hope this helps. Please remember that you can always come to me with your concerns. I would love to help you and your daughter.Warm regards,Laura Spencer, LMSW~ therapist and author~www.LSWLC.com~www.LivingSelfHealing.com~www.LivingWellGutsy.com~www.LivingWellMama.com~www.LivingWellWoman.com~www.LivingWellSelf.com~www.LivingWellSelfHealing.com~www.LivingWellSelfCoaching.com~www.LivingWellSelfHealing.org~www.LivingWellSelfCoaching.org~www.LivingWellSelfWellness.org~www.LivingWellHome.org~www.LivingWellWellness.org~www.LivingWellWellBeing.org~www.LivingWellRelationships.org~www.LivingWellSelfCoaching.org~www.LivingWellSelfHealing.org~www.LivingWellRelationships.org~www.LivingWellSelfCoaching.org~www.LivingWellSelfHealing.org~www.LivingWellSelfBeing.org~www.LivingWellSelfBeingWell.org~www.LivingWellSelfBeingWell.

My fiancé of 15 years is always helping out his family, and I feel like his family takes advantage of his kindness. We're about to get married this Saturday, but I feel like he is always gonna put them first instead of myself and our three kids. I am not enjoying our engagement at all.
One thing that I wonder is if you are having difficulty with communicating in the relationship.One of the main tasks in therapy is to be able to discuss different topics and feelings. As part of this, the therapist will ask questions to help you and your partner open up to one another. In the process of doing this, you will learn more about each other and you may learn new information about yourself that will change how you feel about the relationship.I hope this helps. I wish you the best in your wedding!

We have been fighting a lot and have 3 kids but we both want to stay together. I need some help to save our family.

I am going through a divorce. He is extremely angry. He refuses to physically assist me with our teenager daughter. I have no extended family support. Often times, I feel overwhelmed, tired, and joyless. I feel out of control, sad and depressed on a daily basis. I am just going through the motions of life every day. I am in my mid-50s. I have almost 29 years on my job. How can I handle this?
The relationship you have with your ex is the source of your depression and sense of out of control feelings.Your partner’s unwillingness to assist you with your daughter is a reflection of the person he is.This doesn’t mean the fault is with you or your daughter.Divorce affects all the parties.Especially if there was an abusive relationship, it takes time and energy to process and heal from the relationship.Its normal to feel depressed and sad after such a significant break up.Try to see your relationship as a learning experience. The lesson is that this relationship is over. And you are the one to decide when you are ready for a new relationship. And you are the one who will make this decision by living the life you want to live. This may be time to do things on your own or with the help of a trusted friend or neighbor.Also, re-evaluate your own sense of self-worth. Are you doing the best job you can?

I empathize so much, even with characters on tv or in video games, that I actually feel physical pain. This has made life difficult to say the least. I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder. But since it's such a new disorder I can't find any information about it. Could this be what is going on with me?
Yes, empathy is a wonderful trait to have.

We weren't long distance until he joined the military. I love him and I know he loves, me but it's complicated. He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid. How do I keep our relationship going?
This is a great question. It sounds like you are both wanting a long-distance relationship and are very concerned that he may find someone else. You could both just continue to be honest with each other about your feelings. Each of you could write out what you want from the relationship and then discuss it as a family. Maybe you could start off by sharing with each other what you want and then discuss how that is possible within the military rules. You could also share with him what your fears are and ask him if he could try to reassure you that he is not going to leave. This can be a regular conversation. You could also consider asking him to write a letter to you while he is away. You could share it with your family or have it sent to you. I am sure that he would appreciate the reassurance that you are thinking about him. Good luck!

My doctor seems to think I am in danger of having one. I neglected to ask how this was different than an episode. I have been formally diagnosed with bipolar type 1.
"Hi, I'm sorry to hear about your family members' difficulties. Bipolar disorder is a serious illness that affects the whole family. You can help the rest of the family by recognizing that these people are struggling, and not blaming them for it. I've seen this kind of thing happen with family members who aren't aware that bipolar disorder is a physical illness. They ""catch"" it because someone else is getting sick, or they're drinking too much, or they've been away from their support system too long. Bipolar disorder is treatable, and once you've been diagnosed and treated, you will be able to live a normal life and do the things that are important to you. If your family members are having difficulties, make sure they are getting the proper care and treatment. If they are getting treatment, it's a good idea for you to be a part of it, because it's likely that they will need support and encouragement. This is your family members' health, too, and it's important that they get the care that they need. Best wishes for your family's health. Robin J.

"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?  How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?"
This is a really important question. The thing is, every therapist is different. Some therapists are better at working with issues that you may have and some are better at working with issues that your friends may have. But, the good thing is that you can learn to talk to your therapist about what you need. Your therapist is there to support you throughout your whole journey and they can help you figure out how to get the most out of your sessions. If you feel like you are getting the most out of your sessions but your therapist is not helping you out figure out what you need, you may want to find a therapist who can help you get the most out of your sessions.To give you a general idea of how to find the right therapist:1. If you are looking for a therapist that works in a particular area that you have an issue, you can Google them. (Don't forget to read their website!

My boyfriend of five years told me he cheated on me during our relationship after we broke up. We've since gotten back together and are trying to make it work.

My son stole my debit card and lied about it. It's not the first time he has lied. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I should punish him or make him do something. I've tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong. I have grounded him, but nothing works. What should I do?
Your son sounds like a very challenging child.I have heard of family counseling being beneficial.Has your son told you his reasons for lying?Is he blaming others or is he pointing fingers at himself?It sounds like he may have some self-blame. Is there someone whom you can talk to about this?The most important question is whether there is any improvement in his behavior.If he continues to lie and is blaming others, then it sounds like he needs some more intensive therapeutic help.Lying and blaming others is an indication of a more general problem with self-esteem.He may very well be a wonderful person.This behavior is not who he is.Maybe he feels that he has to live up to some standard that he doesn't feel worthy of.If he can find someone who understands him to talk to and if he can find a therapist who can help him improve his self-esteem and sense of worth, then he may be able to make great progress.Good luck!

I'm being verbally abused on a daily basis by my parents in front of my child. I feel like I’m trapped and I have no escape. I feel like I have to listen to the horrible things they say and just take all of it. I need some way of learning how to cope with listening to it especially since I have nowhere else to go. I feel very emotionally drained How can I deal with this?
First of all, I am so sorry that you are going through this. You are not trapped, and you do have an escape, in fact there are a lot of places that you can go. It is important to remember that you can leave at any time, even if you are running late. You can also leave at any time during the day. So, before you begin to let the verbal abuse affect you, try to create a plan. Make sure that the plan includes at least one person you can call and that person should be another adult. If you can, try to leave with that person, but if you have to stay, try to have a place where you will be safe. If you can, consider leaving with a friend that you can trust. If you are physically unable to leave, try to remember that you can leave. It may be hard to remember that at first, but you can get back to a place where you feel safe. Remembering that you can leave at any time is the most important thing to remember. As far as how you should cope with the verbal abuse, I recommend a book by Lynn Staley called, Speaking to An Abuser: How Families Can Stop Living in Fear and Start Getting Their Lives Back. This book is extremely helpful and I would encourage you to read it. Also, you may want to consider seeing a counselor. If you are still struggling after reading this, please call the Counselors Hotline: 844-487-4899. There are many counselors that are extremely helpful. Hope this helps! Be safe! Robin J.

I think about death all the time because I feel so alone. I want someone to love and someone to love me.
Give yourself love and trust that you will receive love and trust.Life is made up of a series of relationships, either intimate or social. The more we interact with others, the more we have a feeling of being loved and loving others.I suggest you increase the amount of time you spend with people who you feel are loving and trustworthy. Then you will feel less alone.Also, in the interest of loving and trusting others, ask people you know for help. People are more likely to help someone who is in need of their help.Also, I suggest practicing being kind and loving to yourself. This is harder than asking for help. Start by saying nice things about yourself and then practice.Finally, life is about making choices. If your most difficult choice is to find someone to love and be loved by, I suggest you do the best job you can of finding love and learning how to give and receive love.Good luck in your search! :)¿Cómo puedo encontrar a alguien que me ame?

I feel like I took our relationship for granted and he's now to the point that he's giving up. I have had trouble feeling like I could trust him but he's given me no reason not to trust him. I know my attitude is also a big issue for him. I have a lot of obligations at home so we don't spend a lot of time together. How can I fix this relationship?
It may be helpful to see a couples therapist, as a couple to help you both address the specific concerns you have. A therapist can help you to be supportive of each other and can help you to address your individual concerns. A therapist can also help you to identify ways to strengthen your relationship and can help you to set boundaries. If you are unable to see a therapist, your boyfriend may want to consider seeing a therapist to address his concerns and help him to find ways to express his needs. A therapist may also be able to help him to identify ways for you to learn to trust him and ways for you to have better communication. I'm glad that you are able to see that you have some trust issues. The good news is that you can work on that with help. Also, you may want to consider talking to him about what you see as good things in the relationship and what you would like to see in the relationship moving forward. Sometimes talking about the positive things that you see in your relationship can be a good way to communicate that you value it and can help to communicate that you want to make it better. I wish the best of luck to you!

I have these dreams of men, and they always seem to try to hurt me. It's gotten so bad that I first wake at 4:30, then 4:45, and finally stay awake by 6:00. I'm always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake. I hate falling asleep. The longest I've went without sleep is three days.
There are many theories as to why we have nightmares. Perhaps you are able to recognize and work through some of your own thoughts and emotions. The most common theory is that nightmares represent a combination of our fears, thoughts, and emotions while we are sleeping. Try to understand what frightens you the most, what thoughts you are having during the nightmare, and how you feel when you wake up. Some nightmares are recurring, so it may be helpful to ask yourself what the main themes are in these recurring nightmares. Once you are able to identify your own thoughts and emotions that are connected to your nightmares, it may be easier to understand and work through them. There are many ways to work through a nightmare, but it may be helpful to talk about it with a trusted friend, family member, or therapist. If you are able to understand what is causing you distress, you may be able to find a solution to the problem that is causing the stress.

Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram, iMessage, or snapchat people will read my messages but then they won't answer me. Could it be that there is something they don't like about me? I don't understand why they won't answer my messages. How do I get people to respond to me?
Hi there. This is a really common question and a really common pitfall people have when trying to build relationships. You are right - they might not be replying because they don't like you. But, is it possible they don't know who you are? This is often the case. There are many people on social media sites who message, and don't know each other in real life. You can take the time to research them, figure out why they're not replying, and then reach out again. Another factor here is timing. When you send the message, does the other person get it immediately? Or, does it take a few minutes for them to see it? The timing of the message is important. If it's only going to take a few minutes for them to read your message, and they are already in the middle of something else, you're not going to get a response. But, if you send it when they are available, you're more likely to get one. Another thing to consider is if this person has a public or private account. With some social media sites, if you have a public account and someone else doesn't, you're not going to be able to see each other's messages. With Snapchat and Instagram, however, you are both seeing each other's messages. If someone doesn't respond to you, don't get frustrated and assume they're ignoring you. They might not even know who you are. And, if they do know who you are, they might not want to be your friend, or they might not like you. These are all possibilities, but they're not facts. Another thing to consider is whether this person is really interested in you or not. Sometimes you can have the impression that people are interested, but in actuality they're not. If you're starting to feel frustrated by not getting the response you want, there are many other ways to connect with people in your life. Go out for coffee with a friend, stop in the store to say hi to a total stranger, or reach out to someone on social group that you know. We are all connected in some way, so it's always possible to build new relationships. Be well.Robin J.

I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.
I think that is a very common question people ask. There are different ways to answer that question. The first would be to look at your own life and look at what has happened in your life, what have you learned from that, what has affected you? That could also be in looking at family, friends, or even what you watch on television. There are different ways to answer that question. The next would be to ask someone who knows you well or someone you just met and see what they think you are and see what they say. Also, you could look at yourself in a mirror or a camera and just play around with different answers and see what you come up with. But, the best way to find out is by asking someone else. You can also look at a book or website that has different personalities and see what you are like as a person. If you are not sure what you are, take a chance and find out. You may be surprised what you find out. You may be just who you are supposed to be. Robin J.

"I am so sorry to hear of your father's passing. I can imagine that there is a lot going on right now. You mention that you ""never got any help, and five years later, I feel like I can't handle it anymore"" - sounds like you might want to reach out to a therapist. You're right that it can be difficult to cope with the loss of a loved one and it doesn't sound like you have any help to cope with this loss - that is a good sign that you are ready to seek out some help.

I suffer from adult ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depression. It has been difficult to find a doctor in my area and my primary physician won't help. I am unemployed and overwhelmed. What would you suggest I do?
You may be able to find support within your area by looking for a therapist who specializes in ADHD and depression. I recommend searching for counselors on sites like Psychology Today and calling to ask if they offer sliding scale fees. You may also want to reach out to local hospitals and see if they have any counselors or therapists who may be able to help you. I hope you find a therapist who is able to help you through these difficult times. If you are unable to find someone, you may want to consider getting some counseling online. You may find some great counseling websites which offer free counseling if you are unable to pay.

I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.
Anxieties are a bit of a catch all for many different sources of stress. Talking with a therapist can help you gain tools and strategies to manage your anxieties. It may also be helpful to look at the different areas of stress and develop strategies to effectively manage each area. This may require different strategies and goals depending on the area. Another option is to develop a self-care plan that allows you to effectively manage the areas of stress while building self-efficacy in areas such as managing relationships and stress. This self-care plan may include relaxing activities, rewarding yourself, and planning/prioritizing. A therapist can also help you integrate these strategies into your life and make sure they are working effectively. There are also many apps that are available to help you plan and track your self-care activities. These may be a good option if they help you incorporate self-care into your life while still managing other areas of stress. Also, being mindful of your stress is a good way to manage stress. Mindfulness is one way to increase your awareness of your current mental state and teach you skills for self-regulation. There are also many websites and apps that can help you learn mindfulness. It is important to note that mindfulness is not a panacea and should not be used to replace the use of effective strategies such as self-management plans. If you are interested in learning more about mindfulness and how it can help you manage stress, I would recommend reading Mindfulness for Dummies or Mindfulness for Insomniacs, both of which can help you learn the benefits of mindfulness. There are many different apps that are also available to help you practice mindfulness. Another option is to talk with your therapist about whether they can help you learn mindfulness. If you are interested in learning more about self-care planning, I would recommend reading 9 Things Successful People Do Every Day, by Debbie Ford. She talks about making it a part of your routine. The links provided are only a few of the many things that are out there. Hopefully this was helpful and some of these resources may be of use. I would love to hear about how you are managing your anxieties. If you would like to talk, I can be reached at 757-619-1717 or email me at anyhcounselor@live.

On the first day of school I wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like I had bigger boobs. I did that the whole school year and my parents never found out. But now I can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest. How do I fix this?
I'm glad that you know that you would like to have boobs. I think you made a wise choice in wearing a bra that gave the appearance of having boobs. If you are willing to wear a bra that is the correct size for your chest, you can keep that appearance and enjoy being with your friends in your house. You can also appreciate your friends noticing your new chest. It sounds like you are very aware of your actions and are willing to change your behaviors as you would like to. This is very positive. I would encourage you to make an appointment with a therapist who specializes in helping teens with this issue. You may be able to learn how to manage your anxiety and protect your privacy by learning ways to enjoy your new chest.

I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out. How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it. I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy. What should I do?
Probably the most important thing is to be true to yourself and do what feels right for you. If you are attracted to women, that doesn't mean you have to be a lesbian or anything like that. Think about the best way to tell the girl you are interested in. I think it's best to be honest and if the girl is accepting and you both like each other, it can lead to a great relationship. Also, if you do decide to continue crossdressing, you may want to consider getting some counseling to work through any issues you may have with being a gay man in a woman's body. It's very common for gay men to feel like women, including wanting to be feminine. Maybe you can be a gay woman. :) Best of luck!

My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.  The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.
"Trust your instincts and trust your gut!I get the feeling you are doing a great job of watching out for his best interests by being honest with him about things.I can also tell that you are a very kind person who cares about your husband's happiness and well being.Sometimes, even when we are honest, the other person isn't able to handle the truth.I don't know if you could try being a little more tactful in confronting him about the missing beers.Maybe try saying something like ""I really feel like I'm supposed to be your partner in this marriage and I want to be, but I feel like we're not connecting and I want us to reconnect. I feel like we're not connecting. I want us to reconnect. Is there anything I can do for you to help us reconnect?""See how he responds.If he responds by getting defensive or starts to blame you for not ""understanding him,"" try saying something like ""I feel like we're both at fault. I feel like I've tried to connect with you, but I don't know if you feel like you can connect with me. I don't know if you feel like you can trust me.""If you're able to connect with him, listen to his feelings and validate them. If you're able to connect with him, you'll be able to know when you're both not connecting. If you're not able to connect, you'll both feel more comfortable talking about what's going on so you can figure out what's not working and make changes together."" If you're still feeling really uncomfortable after trying some of these suggestions, find a therapist to help you discuss things. A therapist can help you talk through your feelings and you can both look at ways to reconnect."Warmest wishes to you!""-Mark (www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com and www.LivingLovefully.com)"www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com"www.LivingLovefully.com"www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com"www.LivingLovefully.com"www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com"www.LivingLovefully.com"www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com"www.LivingLovefully.com"www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com"www.LivingLovefully.com"www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com"www.LivingLovefully.com"www.MarkMorrisLCSW.

I have been seeing this guy for a little over a year. Back in August, he asked for us to step back for now. Since then, he has still been in contact with me every day. We spent some time together over the holidays, but then I was gone for New Years with family. I came to find out that he put himself on a dating site. When I found out, I asked him about it, and he responded with this: “My apologies if I got my signals crossed, or if I wasn’t honest with you. You have helped me tons this past year and I am glad you are in my life. I didn’t realize you were still interested in dating. Again, my apologies.” Also, is it better to say that I want him in my life or that I want him as part of my life?
It's very common to have a conversation about what the relationship is right now. I would just say, 'I have been with you for a while, and I would like us to be together' or something to that effect. It depends on the level of emotional connection you have, but it's just a way of expressing that you want to be together.The question about what to say and what to ask, really just depends on your emotional level of connection with the other person. If you are still only in the beginning stages of getting to know each other, I would ask how you feel the other person wants you to express yourself. If you are unsure, maybe sending a handwritten note expressing yourself is better than what you wrote above.Good luck!

My spouse decided he no longer wanted me six years ago. Things have deteriorated so badly that we have separated but still live in the same house. He says he despises the sight of me, wants to be with other women, and divorce. What I don't understand is that he says constantly that I have no feelings for him and gets absurdly jealous if I speak to another male. Why does he constantly do these behaviors? I might add he has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and as a narcissist.
I'm so sorry to hear about what you are going through. I am not sure whether your husband has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder or not. If he has been diagnosed, then I would strongly encourage you to take his temperament assessment as well as the assessment for his narcissistic personality type. Once you have his diagnoses, then you can determine what therapy would be most helpful for him. I would also consider couples therapy so you and your husband can work together to repair your marriage. You both need to be willing to make changes and commit to the process of working on your marriage. I would also encourage you to learn about how to recognize emotional and verbal manipulation. It's extremely difficult to see our spouse making negative statements when they are hurtful and take them at face value. It's important to educate yourself on healthy and unhealthy ways of communicating with each other. You can find an excellent book that discusses this topic in detail, The Truth About Love by Dr. Sue Johnson. Then you can talk with your husband about his behaviors and ask him to do a self-assessment for emotional and verbal manipulation. Learning about emotional and verbal manipulation can help you be able to have clear conversations with each other. It will also help you be able to have a therapist guide you through the process. You and your husband need to work together to develop a plan for moving forward. I would suggest having a family therapy session with a therapist that specializes in couples and marriage. Then you can talk about your concerns and your plan for moving forward. I wish you the best!

Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.
I am glad that you are realizing that you are not crazy and that you are struggling with some anxiety. The good news is that you can work through this and it does not necessarily mean that you will be spending eternity in hell. Do you believe in an afterlife? If not, it may be because you have not had the experiences that some people have had who have had near death experiences. Near death experiences are personal accounts of people who have had experiences where they have come close to death and then have had a time when they have seen what is going on outside of their body (i.e. hell, heaven, other realms, etc.).The thing about hell is that the people who are in hell are the people who have chosen to live their lives in a way that does not support others and does not love themselves. There is a great quote that I like that says, If you are in hell, it is because you made your own peace.The good news is that there is an afterlife that people may enter into based on the experiences that they have had in life. This is not necessarily something that will happen to you, but there is a great chance that you will be able to choose where you go after you die. If you are interested in exploring near death experiences, there are many books and websites that can help you with that. Another good website is near-death.com. I hope that you are able to explore and find the answers that you are looking for. I would also encourage you to be kind to yourself and be gentle with yourself. Best of luck to you!

He's gone for 11 weeks for a band camp. It's week two right now. We used to be Intimate a lot, and now since he's busy 12 hours a day, we can't really be Intimate, even over the phone. Is it normal for me to more sensitive in general?
"It might be normal for you to feel more sensitive when your partner is out of the country, but it is certainly not normal to feel ""more sensitive in general."" If you feel that you are not getting enough intimacy with your partner while he's out of the country, it's important to have this conversation with him. When people feel that they aren't getting enough intimacy, they can sometimes think that they need to ""wait it out"" until their partner gets back. However, this is a very short-sighted approach. If you have difficulty being intimate with your partner while he is out of the country, and if you feel that this is impacting your relationship, you should have this conversation.The important thing is to be honest about what you are both feeling and thinking.""It sounds like you and your partner need to have this conversation to find out what you need from each other and how to get it.""I suggest finding a time when you are both calm and having a discussion that is not angry or frustrated. Also, try to find a time when you both have a few hours to spend together. If you are experiencing anxiety, I suggest seeing a professional therapist. It sounds that you are feeling a lot of pressure in this situation.""Best of luck!

"My wife and I have a great relationship except for our sex lives. We are pretty transparent and honest, and basically, she feels bad because she never wants to have sex. She doesn't have the desire. She's also never orgasmed. She feels like a terrible wife and fears I'll cheat on her. She doesn't know why. Last time we had sex, she cried and felt bad and didn't know why she cried. However, she also told me that the last time we had sex, she felt me in her, but it just felt ""ehh"" and wanted to stop. That makes me feel really awful. We rarely have foreplay. Everything I try tickles her, so she makes me stop. We are both frustrated but very much in love. She and I are in our early 20s. We’re married and we have a baby on the way."
Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you and your wife are having problems in the bedroom. I would say that the problem is not one person and the problem is not one sex life, it's two people and their sex lives. To have a healthy sex life, you need to both be on the same page. Have you discussed your concerns about her lack of desire with her? If not, maybe you should consider doing so. While she might be feeling guilty that she's making you feel awful, the solution is not to let her get away with it. You need to communicate in an assertive way, but in a way that does not come across as mean or angry. You need to tell her that you're frustrated and want to figure out what to do. Without raising your voice or getting upset, you need to tell her that you feel like she's pushing you away and that she doesn't seem like she wants to be intimate with you. In that same message, you need to ask her how she's feeling and let her know that you want to know what she's thinking and how she's doing. Ask her to open up and be vulnerable with you. If she is not willing to do that, she will close up, and you may never get an answer. I would recommend that you also see a counsellor to learn some assertive skills that you can use when talking to your wife about her lack of desire. Best of luck!

I don't have time to live or take care of myself at times. It's causing depression, stress, and anxiety. I don't know what to do.
Take time to get and stay healthy. Your physical body is the house your mind and spirit live in. If you don't take care of your body, your spirit will not have a place to go. I see this all the time. People are so busy, they don't take time to tend to their spirit. We need to recharge and that can't be done when we are exhausted and stressed. Be sure to take time to rest, sleep, exercise and eat well. Redirect your energy and find some activities that make you feel good about yourself. And most of all, ask yourself what is it you are trying to accomplish. If the answer is not clear cut, try to refocus. It is not easy to say goodbye to things that are taking you where you want to be, but if you want to change, you will have to change. How do you want your life to be? What do you need to do to get there? Start small and put yourself on a path that you can achieve. You can do it!

I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately. I was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Lately, I've been questioning everything from my career to my relationship. My boyfriend and I just moved in a few months ago. All of a sudden, I don't feel as comfortable around him as I used to, although I can't seem to find a reason as to why I feel this way.
"Hello. I am very sorry to hear of your struggle. One of the first things I would like to tell you is that there is help. I have counseled many individuals who have anxiety and panic attacks. This article by Psych Central is a great resource: http://www.psychcentral.com/lib/ways-to-handle-anxiety-in-humans/ One of the most common and effective ways to decrease anxiety is to do cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with a professional counselor. You can also do CBT alone by utilizing the techniques taught in the Cognitive Behavioral Workbook Series. Another method for decreasing anxiety is through the use of self-help books. I would recommend the books listed here: http://www.therapy4selfhelp.com/self-help-books-anxiety.htmlAs for your relationship, it sounds as if you may be in a rut. If you are not being fulfilled in your relationship, you may want to consider seeing a relationship therapist to see if there are ways to increase the intimacy and intimacy-related behaviors between you. You may also want to consider seeing a therapist to address your career and relationship. A therapist may be able to assess your level of happiness and what areas of your life you may want to change. It is important to be honest with yourself and question the reasons behind your discomfort and what may be causing it. If you are having panic attacks while driving or at work, I would recommend calling 911 and receiving immediate medical care. The anxiety and panic attacks you are experiencing may be signs of a medical condition. I would recommend going to see a doctor. Another method for decreasing anxiety is through medication. If anxiety medication is a necessity for you, you may want to consider a psychiatrist who specializes in working with individuals who suffer from anxiety.I hope this was helpful. Please remember that there is help and you are not alone. Best of luck to you! Laura"My boyfriend and I recently moved in together.

It means that an opinion can be respected and listened to, or it can be ignored.There are plenty of people who are willing to listen to their partners and then do what they want anyway.

I feel like I have to be promiscuous in order to keep people around? It started after I got raped by my ex-boyfriend.
Your answer is a good one.Your answer is that the way to handle your need for the presence and affection of others, is to accept the need.Relationships require effort from both people. If you become used to having others around, then when they leave, you may feel empty.Instead of becoming promiscuous, consider becoming satisfied by getting to know the people you do have relationships with.Whether you are with a boyfriend or girlfriend, consider talking with them about your life, and whether you would like to spend time together.Exercising the effort to be in relationship with others, may help you to be satisfied with your relationships.Good luck in your relationships!

I got sick really bad and was throwing up for three days and nights. I thought I was going to die. Then about a week later, I started having this desire to be female. I never had this desire before. All I can think about is being a woman. I don't get pleasure from my penis anymore either. Women are attractive, but not like before. I can also find men attractive now. I'm too ashamed to tell anyone.
"I'd be interested in what you associate with being female. You say ""I want to be a woman"". That sounds more like you want to live as a woman than that you feel you are one already.In the past, you may have heard the word ""transsexual"" and assumed it was the same as what you're saying. It isn't. A transsexual person is a person who feels they were born into the wrong body and want to change it. You may want to be a woman but that doesn't mean that you want to change your body. You may want to live as a woman, but that doesn't mean you would want to change your body.If you really are considering changing your body, I would recommend seeing a therapist first. I don't know what you're thinking, but telling your doctor about wanting to be female may not be the best idea. In the meantime, if you feel like you're starting to live in a way that reflects this desire, that's ok. Keep doing what you're doing. Feeling is ok. Just don't expect the world to change just because you want it to. I'm curious about what you're ashamed of. In your question, you say that you're ashamed to tell anyone. But I don't see it there. You're telling me something about being embarrassed about something that you're feeling. As you're working through this, you may start to feel differently about what you're ashamed of. Again, as you're living this life, you may start to feel differently.But the more important question is what do you associate with being male?

"Hello, and thank you for your question. First, I want to say that if you are only reading through the first couple of responses, I commend you for being honest about your feelings and for asking for some feedback. It is very rare to see this type of honesty. As for your question, I believe that you may have some depression or a more serious mood disorder. I can tell this from your description of what you are experiencing, but it would be difficult to diagnose you from that description. It sounds like your symptoms are interfering with your daily life in a negative way. It sounds like you are very unhappy and would like some help. In my professional opinion, I would recommend you see a medical doctor to rule out a medical cause for your symptoms. If you are diagnosed with depression, a prescription for an antidepressant will likely help you feel better and get your life back on track. It sounds like you are trying to figure out what to do. In addition, there are many organizations and websites that offer free counseling. I recommend that you look into getting some counseling. Counseling may not fix your problem, but it will likely help you cope with your problem. There are many different types of counselors, and there are many different types of counseling. Some counselors may be better suited for a specific type of problem. If you can get counseling from a therapist who specializes in depression, I think that would be a good idea. If you are unable to get counseling, I would recommend trying to find some friends who you can talk to about your feelings. Maybe that is something that you can do over lunch or at a work event?

I feel like I hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes. How can I start accepting myself and be more confident?
"To start being confident, you need to first be comfortable with who you are. To do this you need to not compare yourself to other people. One way to be more confident is to join a group or class. That way you can meet others with similar interest and work toward the same goal. Another way is to find a therapy that caters to your needs. A therapist can help you explore why you feel you hate yourself and develop skills to cope."If you are a man, you may want to ask your family for feedback. Women tend to be more aware of their own self worth than men. "Good luck!"Cindy"WTF is confidence, and how do I get it?

You can create your own peace and contentment by trusting your inner wisdom and knowing that you are perfect exactly as you are. The key is to go within and start working on yourself with your own therapist.

My daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of 10. She then started to act younger than she is. Now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesn't act her age. I don't know why this is happening. Is this normal?
"While I agree that ""normal"" is a slippery term, I do see that you are very concerned about your daughter's behavior. While there is no absolute answer as to why a child would suddenly behave a certain way (even if it is for a brief time), it is helpful to try to gather as much information as possible about the child and their situation to try and understand what might be going on. One thing to consider is that many children who are in the 9-10 year old range are still being evaluated and treated as younger children. Children in this age range may seem ""normal"", but they are probably not. Some of the behaviors that I see can be as simple as a child wanting to play with other children or wanting to play a certain kind of game that they did not play as a child. But, there could be a lot more to it. A child may feel more comfortable with other children their own age. Younger children may have more energy and may want to spend more time with adults who are still in a very energy-intensive phase of their life. So, if we look at the situation from this perspective, I would consider talking with your daughter about what she is interested in and see if she would be willing to spend more time with you and her siblings to see what is going on. I would also ask her what she is doing when she is not with you, her siblings, and the other children who she likes to play with. If she is spending more time with younger children, I would see if she could see the other children that she likes to play with. This could be a short-term or a long-term situation. I would also consider talking with a mental health provider to see if they could help you see what is going on. If your daughter is younger than 10 and is interested in an older child, I would encourage you to try and find out what it is that they are interested in. If they are interested in an older sibling, I would encourage you to ask the older sibling to spend more time with the younger one. With more time spent together, it is more likely that the younger child will have a more positive relationship with the older child. I hope this helps and best of luck!

How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?
"I've been in therapy for almost three years now and I just had my first termination session. I'm a 21-year-old college student and I was really happy to see that my counselor has a ""termination session"" in his calendar.

A lot of people tend to avoid discussing their feelings with their parents because they feel like they may not be heard or they may not be able to fully understand what the teen is experiencing.

For the past four weeks, I've been having nightmares and hearing voices telling me of horrible things. They're not random voices, but rather, the voices of those I care about.
"Hello, and thank you for your question. I am always interested in learning more about how people are managing their symptoms, as well as other aspects of their lives.The short answer is that a lot of people have different reactions to experiencing symptoms of a condition like PTSD. It can be difficult to tell if you are having a recurrence of symptoms, or if the symptoms are a result of the experiences that led to your symptoms. If you are hearing voices in your nightmares, this may be related to the trauma. However, hearing voices in the day-to-day life of your waking experience may also be related to your trauma. So, it is very important to talk to someone about your experiences if you are having these symptoms. I also want to make clear that it can be difficult to distinguish between symptoms related to PTSD and other conditions. It is common for people to experience anxiety and/or panic attacks after experiencing a trauma. In some cases, these symptoms can be quite traumatic for people. So, it is important that people talk to someone about the symptoms if they are experiencing them. There are also many people who do not experience PTSD symptoms and still have a lot of trauma related experiences. One of the things that is really helpful for some people is mindfulness practices. Mindfulness is a way of being in the present moment and being aware of your thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations. Mindfulness is a practice that many people use to help them manage their symptoms. While mindfulness can be helpful, it should not be considered a cure for trauma. If you are interested in learning more about mindfulness, it would be helpful to find an experienced therapist. Also, it is important that you always talk to your primary care provider or doctor if you are experiencing any type of health related symptom, including anxiety and panic attacks. I hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J.

After 40 years of being straight, how could I now find myself interested in people of the same sex? I have had a few same sex encounters of my own doing.
The only way to find out if you are experiencing sexual attraction to the same sex is to actually try it. The reason for this is that, there is no way for a counselor to know if you are, or are not, sexually attracted to people of the same sex, without you actually being in the position of actually being attracted to a person of the same sex. If you find yourself interested in same sex relationships, consider starting with a brief questionnaire on this site. www.therapyheal.com The therapist I currently work with is Christian. The thoughts and prayers are with you!

A few years ago I was making love to my wife when for no known reason I lost my erection, Now I'm In my early 30s and my problem has become more and more frequent. This is causing major problems for my ego and it's diminishing my self esteem. This has resulted in ongoing depression and tearing apart my marriage. I am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues. I am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like I used to. What could be causing this, and what can I do about it?
"Thank you for your question. There are several possible reasons for a decrease in sexual drive, including: (1) The presence of medical disorders such as diabetes, thyroid disease, kidney disease, and endocrine system disorders (PCOS); (2) Anxiety and fear of losing the ability to perform sexually, anxiety and fear of disappointing your partner and/or fear of disappointing yourself; (3) Fear of having to go through with a medical procedure that requires you to be completely relaxed and naked; (4) Fear of being inadequate or not satisfying your partner sexually; (5) Fear of not being good enough in the eyes of the God to whom you pray and trust; (6) Fear of feeling inadequate in the eyes of your partner; (7) Fear of being overwhelmed by the desire to have sex and having no time to sit down and relax yourself; (8) Fear of being caught up in a moment of temptation; (9) Feeling pressured by a friend or family member to have sex; and (10) Any combination of these causes. It is hard to know exactly what is going on without direct and honest communication between you and your wife. You may have other contributing factors that you are not aware of, or your wife may not be willing to discuss with you some of the issues that may be contributing to her distress. If you can both agree that she would like to discuss her feelings and experiences with you, you may be able to get some answers together. In general, if there is an erection, but no physical intercourse, the sexual desire is there. If there is no erection, then the problem is that the physical, emotional, and spiritual connection is not there for either of you. You may have to consider some changes in the way that you approach your relationship, in order to increase the physical intimacy and emotional closeness. And, you may have to start making some changes in your approach to who you are as a sexual partner to your wife. Do you want to be intimate with her?

We got into arguments, and we would break if off but start it back up again. We clicked, or so I thought. We are both married with problems in our marriage. We never have sex; we just send a lot of pictures back and forth and talk about doing things together. His wife found out, and he lied to her and didn't even refer to it as an affair. I can't stop thinking about him. We just click. I've been married for 16 years, and I've never liked anyone other than my husband. Now I like him, and we’ll never be together.
"Sorry to hear you are feeling so sad and uncertain about your feelings.You seem to be attracted to your husband and want to be with him.This is a lot more complicated than ""yes, I like him, but I am married and that is not allowed"".Maybe you can talk with your husband about your feelings on a few dates. You will both have time to better understand each other's thoughts and emotions. This is a good way to start a discussion between people who have been living together for a while and feel comfortable with each other.Once you learn more about each other, you may be able to decide whether to be together or apart. This may take some time."Like" is not the same as ""love""."Love" comes from being in a committed relationship with someone. Only in being together in daily life, will you find out if you love each other.There is nothing wrong with being attracted to someone, if you are not in a committed relationship with them.The key is to learn if you love your husband.

"She has trouble falling and staying asleep and she's always either extremely hungry or not hungry at all. She also gets angry and feels like crying really easily for no reason. She says she is always ""kind of down."" Is this depression? What can I do to help her?"
I think this is probably a lot of things. I am not 100% sure that this is depression, but I believe that it could be. Often times, when we hear the word depression we tend to think that it means feeling really sad or down, but it is much more than that. Depression is a spectrum disorder and so it can be broken down into many different sub-types. One of the differentiating factors between major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder is that dysthymic disorder is not accompanied by a significant amount of sadness. I wonder if this young lady is experiencing the symptoms of depression, but is not calling it that. The only way you can really know for sure is to have her evaluate her feelings with a counselor. I wonder if she is taking medication for the symptoms that she is experiencing. In general, the types of symptoms that this young lady is having could be symptoms of major depression, but it could also be symptoms of a variety of other disorders as well.One of the things that you can do is to offer her options when it comes to treatment. If she is experiencing the symptoms and is not willing to seek treatment, you can use the resources that are available to you through your school's student health center. It might be worth contacting them and having them speak to your daughter about making use of the services that they have available. It is also important to have her evaluated by a counselor if she decides to seek treatment.In general, though, I would recommend that she take her feelings seriously, talk to her counselor about how she is feeling and see if she can get some treatment. In the meantime, I would recommend that you continue to check in with her and if there are times that she is not eating, she may be experiencing some of the symptoms of anorexia or bulimia. It is also important that she gets plenty of rest, and it might be worth having her talk to someone about feeling down or being overly tired. Hope this helps and good luck! Take care. Robin J.

My mom and I have been fighting a lot now, and I just want a good relationship with her.
You are not alone in your desire to have a good relationship with your mom. Here is a starting point for you to consider: What are your strengths? Do you feel your strengths would be helpful in having a better relationship with her? Are there specific situations in which you feel she is being supportive of you or listening to you? If you could pinpoint a few times or moments in which you feel she is supportive and you are able to tell her, this may help you both to feel connected.If you don't feel your strengths would be helpful in having a better relationship with your mom, consider talking with a mental health professional who can help you to identify your strengths and then find ways to build on them. The mental health field is filled with therapists who specialize in working with families. You may also look into therapy classes at your local community college. Many schools have online courses that you may be able to do at home and still receive credit for completing the class. This may be a way to have a supportive relationship with your mom while you work on yourself.If you feel your best way to have a good relationship with your mom is to not talk to her, I would encourage you to talk with your mom's therapist and consider discussing what you are able to discuss and what you want to discuss. Here is a link to a guide for talking with a therapist about family and relationship issues. Here is another link for a template for a support plan. These are just two options for how to discuss this with your mom's therapist. There are a lot of things that come with the territory of having a parent. It is an incredibly important relationship, and I think it is incredibly important for you to find ways to have a good relationship with your mom. You don't have to do it alone. Working with a therapist may help you both.Good luck to you!

My boyfriend is always saying he's done with me and says he's leaving, but then at the end of the night, he's still here. He wakes up in the morning, acts like nothing happen, and repeats this every night.
It is always a challenge to keep a relationship, especially when there is abuse. It is important to remember that relationships require two people to be happy and healthy. It is important to consider how you can work together to make the relationship better. If abuse is present it is important to have a plan in place to leave the abusive relationship. If you are unable to leave, it is important to have a safety plan and a way to communicate about safety. Communication is key and can be a barrier to abuse when it is difficult to communicate about important things. Having a safe person that you can talk to about these things is important. Now, there are some people that do not abuse but may have issues with their behavior. This would be called “codependency.” Codependents have issues with controlling behaviors and have trouble asking for what they need. It is important to see a professional to help with these issues. It is important to remember that if a relationship is not healthy, it will not last. It is important to stay focused on your own happiness. Finding your own hobbies and interests is important so that you can have time to do things that make you happy. Remembering to take care of yourself is important. Not doing things that you know will make you sick, such as drinking too much or engaging in risky behaviors is also important. Taking care of yourself will allow you to be the best partner that you can be for your significant other. Good luck! If you are in need of help, please contact me. www.suareztherapy.com 909-792-7070.

My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. She calls me every day complaining, but I don't want to hear it anymore.
Sorry to hear about your mom's distress. You're right to resist her complaining, since it will worsen her feelings. She doesn't need to feel burdened by your unwillingness to listen to her.Since you can't be with your mom, the best you can do is help your mom to get some better support for herself. She may be overwhelmed by caring for her niece. She may need a therapist to help her manage her stress. She may need to make a decision about whether she wishes to care for her niece. The more she gets of herself and the less she needs you to take care of her, the better she will feel. Her own self-care is her responsibility and not yours.Best wishes in your life!

My brother has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has not been taking his medication.

I was adopted in by his dad (who just passed) and his mother will not Get involved because she's afraid of financial responsibility. Do I have the rights to be able to sign my brother into mentalhealth facility?
One thing you may try is to contact the local hospital's emergency room department and talk with them about your brother's situation.The hospital would most likely be willing to admit your brother so they can monitor him and give him the medication he requires. Then, your brother would be in a hospital setting where professionals are caring for him and making sure he is safe.Also, keep in mind that your brother may be aware of his situation and be feeling scared, alone, and overwhelmed by his schizophrenia.If your brother is feeling this way and you can talk with him and listen to him, your talking to him and listening to him may make a difference in how he feels.The best way to know what your rights are, is to ask the hospital personnel you contact for advice.They are more likely to be able to answer your questions and to tell you what you can expect.A good place to start is by calling 911 if you are worried about your brother.The police officers may be able to help your brother.I hope these suggestions help you have an idea of what is possible. Your brother may be surprised that you are willing to try to help him.I wish him the best!

"Do you have a support system of friends? A group of people whom you can go to with your problems? Perhaps this group of friends isn't as ""bothersome"" as you perceive them to be. If no such group exists, consider starting one yourself. A group of people whom you trust with your problems, is an important part of a healthy relationship. A relationship which isn't plagued with the ""bothersome"" is one which is worth having. Find your own annoyances and work on fixing them. You'll feel better and be more enjoyable to be around.

It sounds like you would like to keep your contact with your child as frequent as possible, but the mother of your child is trying to make your life as difficult as possible.

You will have many questions answered and will be able to come up with a plan that you can support. In the meantime, try to be gentle with yourself.

I have an emotionally abusive relationship. We have been together for a year and a half. He got out of prison exactly a year ago and a half ago, and we have a infant. I love my boyfriend, and I don't want to leave without fighting for this first. He's an emotionally disconnected person. We never say “I love you” to each other. Every fight is worse than the last one, and I don't know what to do. He doesn't let me speak because he's louder than me, and that makes me feel frustrated. I have another problem: English is my second language. I pay half of the bills, and every time I want to speak to him, he kicks me out of the house. He apologizes sometimes. I feel like I'm the only one fighting for this. He agreed to have counseling.
"In terms of communication and verbal abuse, it is key that you learn how to assert yourself and make your needs known to your boyfriend. Even if you are not sure you are right or that he is wrong, you still have the right to be heard. Your feelings are valid and validating them can help you feel better. It can also help him to know that he is hearing what you are saying.I'm not sure if your boyfriend is bilingual. It might help for him to learn some basic phrases for you to say when you are upset so that you can communicate your needs and so that you can apologize when you are in the wrong. Unfortunately, there is no ""right way"" to communicate or respond. It is best to learn how to respond in a way that makes you feel respected and supported. This is a part of what you can learn from a counselor, not from your boyfriend.In terms of ending the relationship, you need to think about what you can stand and what you can't stand.

I am so terrified of having sex anymore because I have been told over and over that sex is dangerous even though me and my partner used both forms of protection. My partner is not happy about this and simply wants more sex, and honestly, I want to give that to her.
It's understandable that you would be anxious about engaging in sex. You're not alone. Many people are hesitant about having unprotected sex for a number of reasons. One of the main areas of concern is fear of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. One way to lessen your anxiety is to engage in sexual activities that are pleasurable for you. There are many ways to enjoy the sex act, so consider reading some books or blogs on sensual sexuality and experiment with new ideas. Another way to enjoy sexual activities is by asking your partner questions about what turns them on and/or what scares them. This can help you to better understand what they are looking for. Last, find a counselor who specializes in sexual dysfunction and/or couples. I hope this helps. Good luck.

Hi, Nebraska. I'm glad you're taking a moment to think about who has hurt you in the past. I'm glad you're questioning some of the assumptions you've made about yourself and you're even taking steps to get some support to move past this. I'm so proud of you. It takes courage to go through what you are going through. I wish I had some words of encouragement, but this is really a time to listen to your own inner guidance. I'd be curious to know what has led you to some of your thoughts about yourself, but I also encourage you to be curious about your new thoughts. I imagine there are times when you have taken those old hurtful thoughts and given them a voice. I'm curious if you can see the voice and then ask the voice to step aside so you can hear the new voice...maybe that voice is saying that these people have done nothing to you to hurt you. It's natural to have different thoughts about people we care about and it's also healthy to confront old hurts. The next question is what do you want?

Maybe this is a stupid question, but I sometimes don't know what's real or not. If feel at times like everyone's lying. How do I know if God is one of those lies?
"Great question! It's so helpful to me that you recognize that sometimes ""everyone's lying"" and that you are having a hard time knowing if God is real or not. I think that in your life you have had relationships that have been hurtful, abusive or neglectful. As a result, you may have developed a sense of mistrust or fear towards other people. I would like to encourage you to take a look at your interactions with others and see if you can find where this fear is coming from. Have you ever been hurt by someone and felt as if you had no choice but to put up with it? If so, this is an example of being mistreated. I would also encourage you to take a look at who you are around. Is there someone that you can be around for a long time and feel safe? Maybe this person is someone in your family. Maybe it's a friend. Maybe it's an acquaintance. Do you have someone like this in your life? If so, who is it and how can you reach out to that person and be there for them?Now let's talk about God. Do you believe in a God? If so, what is that image of God that you have in your mind? How do you feel when you think about this God? I would encourage you to take a look at the image that you have of God. Is it loving? Unforgiving? Does it make you feel safe or nervous? This is a good time to talk to a therapist about all of this. What you believe about God directly affects how you feel about yourself and how you interact with others.I hope this helps you out. I know that it is a struggle to trust others, but if you have been mistreated it can be a difficult thing to do. You can ask God for help to see if he is real and to give you the strength to reach out to others.I wish you the best.""God is real, God loves you, God wants to help you. Believe in God and you will see evidence of this. The world around you is real. God cannot be everywhere, and we are often mislead by the things we cannot see, but God can give you the strength to reach out to others and find love in your life.""Oh, I have a lot of questions! Do you have any resources that I could look at? What else do you think would be helpful to know? I find it very hard to trust others, and I don't know what to do.

I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.

"Fear is typically a signal that something is wrong, and that you need to pay attention and attend to the problem.Our minds often try to convince us of something that isn't actually the case. This is the ""fear response"" of the mind, which is designed to help you be prepared for potential harm or danger.Sometimes, however, we just have insecurities about ourselves that don't really have anything to do with anything bad happening. If you are struggling with insecurities about yourself, then I recommend reading this book: Your Weirdest Dreams (And Their Meanings), by Michelle Cooper I also recommend checking out: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-self-protection-mechanism-self-esteem-self-esteem-sandwichI hope this helps. Remember, if you need more help, there are many counselors out there who are happy to help.""Check out my book on Amazon!

Whether it's to a guy or girl, I always feel insecure talking, and I am afraid of embarrassing myself and not being good enough. Even when I am walking, I worry about my appearance and facial expression and such.
Have you ever been told what kind of face you have? Or is there some other way you know whether a person is happy or not?Likely the more you talk with others and gain confidence in yourself, the more self-assured you will feel in talking with others.This sounds like a task for therapy.All of us worry sometimes. And maybe you will have some good insight on why you worry so much in particular situations.Also, who you talk to, the reason they talk with you, whether they like who you are, will all influence how you feel while speaking with them.Good luck in making new friends! :)~Carl Landwehr~www.carlitoitsinthehead.com~carl@carlitoitsinthelloworld.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.comwww.carlitoitsinthehead.

I'm fine when we start becoming intimate, but out of nowhere, I will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past. I start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me.
It sounds like you are having flashbacks of something that happened in the past. It could be very helpful to explore the meaning of these flashbacks with a therapist. Do you remember what the trigger is for them to occur?

I am in a high stress position for a tech company. I am being overworked and underpaid for my contributions and it is not only giving me anxiety, but also demoralizing. What can I do to manage my stress?
The answer to this question depends on where you are in your life. I encourage you to understand what is at the root of your stress. What are you working on? What are you selling? What are your long-term goals? Is your compensation on par with your work? Are you being recognized for your contributions?I don't know whether the company you work for is paying you enough, but if it is paying more than you are worth, you need to address this with your employer. You don't have to wait for an offer for a new job. Talk to your employer about your value and try to get a raise or negotiation on your compensation package. If you are not receiving one, consider talking to a business counselor or other employee advocate to help you reach your goals and see what you can do within the organization to get what you need. Best of luck to you!

I started dating a guy I met online. He told me that he registered sex offender but he didn't do anything. He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years. That was more than two decades ago. Nothing on his record since. I always believe the past should be left in past. But my roommates, their family and my son are unforgiving. Should I forgive this man that I'm falling in love with or should I dump him? If I stay with him I will never see my family and granddaughter again.

I'm a female in my mid 20s. Lately I tend to over drink and I've become a very angry drunk. In the past, I have even cheated on my boyfriend while I was under the influence of alcohol. But now, even if I don't do anything wrong and don't embarrass myself, I still feel really guilty after a night of drinking. I don't understand why I'm feeling this way. Does this mean I have a problem?
"It is understandable that you would feel guilty after a night of drinking. Maybe you're wondering if you have a drinking problem. It is important to remember that everyone drinks differently and everyone has different ""drinking triggers."" It is also important to remember that drinking in moderation (1-2 drinks) is not associated with any negative health effects. There is no ""normal"" drinking amount for everyone, and anyone could have a problem drinking excessively. It could be that the ""problem"" is more about the way you feel about yourself after drinking. Some people have a guilt complex about drinking. In that case, drinking could be a way to relieve that guilt. It could also be that you've developed a drinking habit and your guilt is trying to tell you something important. It is important to remember that in a relationship with a therapist, you could work through these feelings and use them as a learning experience.""If you don't know where to go for help, please consider talking with a therapist about it.""Best of luck to you!

I know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice. Sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him. Once he believes I am being negative I can't seem to find a better way of communicating. In fact, it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating. What advice might you offer?
Understand that your husband is not wrong and that you are not being guilty of anything. A good way to handle this is to focus on the positive things he does in your relationship and tell him that. Although you may feel hurt, this is not the best way to handle the situation. Also if your husband has a specific way he wants you to talk to him then ask if you can talk to him about this and he can tell you what he wants.This is not something that can be fixed by talking about it. It can only be resolved by looking at it together and coming up with a solution. A professional couples therapist can help you with this. There are lots of books out there that can help you too.Good luck!

Sometimes, I'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth. I've always thought it was normal and I was just nervous, but the other day, it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself.
Hi there, I am glad you are asking this question. It sounds like there is some real anxiety being present for you. A lot of people have anxiety about talking to people. But, when people feel anxious about talking to someone, it is because they are afraid of what that person will think of them. Often, we think of social interactions as being about the other person, but in reality, it is a lot of what we think and do that is on display. Also, think of social interactions as a dance. We each have parts of our bodies, expressions, and words that we can use to express ourselves, but then there are parts of the other person's body and expressions, and parts of their language that they can use to do the same. The way we move through that dance determines if we think of ourselves positively and the other person positively, or if we feel judged and criticized. What is the thought process behind why you are concerned about your anxiety?

She's busy because her mom makes her clean all the time and go out places with her family. We don't talk much because of it. Also, we have little fights. We want to work it out but we don't know how.
"I'm sorry your relationship is being negatively impacted by your mom's controlling behavior. If she is a part of your life, you are bound to be affected. You can ask your mom if she would be willing to work on the relationship she has with you. Maybe she is willing to give you some time with your girlfriend. She can talk to you about her expectations of how she wants you to treat her and how she wants you to interact with your girlfriend. This may not be possible for you and your girlfriend to work through, but it's an option. If she is not willing to work on the relationship, you can tell her that you still want to be in the relationship but she is not allowed to use control as a way to get her way. You may need to make that decision for yourself. I would suggest you talk to a therapist about what is going on with you. You may need to seek out support in the form of a therapist or a community support system. Do not blame your girlfriend. Blame only your mom and try to find a way to move forward in your relationship and with your mom."I can tell you are a great guy and you deserve to have a loving relationship with a woman who respects and supports you."

My grandma had a stroke and passed away recently. I lost my home and job. I'm looking but haven't found a job. I've been binge watching television and binge eating.
I would suggest looking into therapy in order to help you cope with the loss of your job and home. I would also suggest looking at your loss of weight. What are you doing when you binge eat? Are you in some sort of emotional pain? What are you doing when you binge watch television? Are you really allowing yourself to feel sad, empty, and numb? These are all signs that you may have an eating disorder. If so, I would strongly encourage you to reach out for help. Looking for a new job and losing weight are great things, but if you end up suffering from an eating disorder in the process, you can end up losing your life. I would seriously look into therapy to help you cope with what you are going through. And remember, you don't have to go through this alone!

I'm in my late teens and live with my dad. The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks. Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right. Are they right, am I depressed?
It sounds like you are struggling with a combination of feelings. You are obviously concerned about your social life and your feeling that you are not worth knowing. These could certainly be signs of depression. It is important to note that you are still young and many of these issues may resolve themselves naturally over time. If you would like to talk with someone, there are many free resources available. An excellent website for teens who are going through similar experiences is www.teenpintalk.com. There are many teens who are also going through similar things who have started speaking out and connecting with each other. If you decide to talk to someone, I would encourage that you find someone who can help you with your specific needs. You can also see if there are any community centers which provide free resources. Good luck! and remember that you are not alone. Many teens have similar feelings and have been able to find ways to cope. As long as you are doing something that you enjoy, you can find a way to cope.¿Estoy enfermo o depresivo?

I don't know how else to explain it. All I can say is that I feel empty, I feel nothing. How do I stop feeling this way?
"I am sorry you are feeling this way. I would recommend that you meet with a competent therapist who specializes in working with individuals who experience chronic feelings. It may be helpful to work through this with a therapist who has experience working with individuals who have dissociation symptoms.I would encourage you to consider what is happening when you dissociate. It may help to think of a time when you did not dissociate. When you are able to think about what was happening, you are able to engage the external world and stop dissociation. This is the ""time when you didn't dissociate"" and ""when you were feeling something else"" I believe you are referring to.""Empty"" may mean different things to different people. A therapist may be able to help you sort through what that means for you."I feel nothing" may be different than ""I feel empty."" A therapist may be able to help you sort through what that means for you."I wish you the best!

I find that I imagine things sexually, and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship. I feel helpless and guilty. I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.
"From what you wrote it sounds like you and your girlfriend have some communication problems. Maybe you could find a way to discuss some of the issues you have with her. Perhaps you can start a conversation about your feelings about wanting to watch porn and how she feels about it. You could also discuss what you would like to see in the relationship and what you would like to change about each other. If you feel you would like to stop watching porn, maybe you could find a way to make that happen. All of this can be done without blame and without anger. This would give you a chance to explore what is actually going on in your relationship and also your own feelings. I would recommend seeing a therapist to help you to have discussions like these that stay calm and respectful. Even if you don't stop watching porn, you could learn more about why you are doing it, what you are thinking and feeling, and ways to have better control over your viewing habits. I would also recommend finding time to talk with your girlfriend about what you are experiencing. Discussing it may lead to talking about it and having a discussion about it may help to resolve the issue. You could also discuss it with your girlfriend and a therapist. This is about your feelings and feelings are very personal. If you and your girlfriend decide to talk about it, then let the therapist and your girlfriend know how you are feeling and what you would like to happen. The therapist and your girlfriend may help facilitate some of these discussions. I hope you have a very successful resolution. Best of luck to you and your girlfriend!

As a child, my parents injured my brother, so they went to prison. I was there when he had gotten hurt, but I can't seem to remember. I also can't remember being with them quite well. It's a blur.

I am so angry. I feel like the arguments with my parents have caused me so much anxiety and stress, and I don't know what to do. I want to sit down with a psychologist, but I cannot afford one, nor do I have my own health insurance. I can feel myself starting to get violent. I throw things of value when I start to get mad. I have punched holes in my wall. I can feel my aggression getting worse.
"While there are not any specific laws or guidelines for parents to provide mental health services for their children, I do think it is a great idea for you to see a psychologist. It sounds like you are having a really hard time managing some of your emotions, and a professional can help you to find some new ways to cope with your emotions. Your parents may also be able to help you to learn new ways to cope with your emotions by offering you the space to talk about your feelings. It may also be helpful for you to speak with your school counselor about finding some way to manage your stress. Some kids find it helpful to have some things that they can count on during times of stress. You may also find it helpful to spend time with friends or family members. If you have a support group or some other group that you can go to for support and ideas about how to deal with stress, that would be even better. While there are no legal requirements for parents to provide mental health services for their children, I would like to suggest that you try asking your parents for help and for their support. When we are in tough situations we often rely on our friends and loved ones to help us. I hope this helps. Best of luck to you!

Does counseling really do anything that can help people?
Counseling is a way to improve one's self esteem and relationship with others. The person would look to give the best advice possible to the client. This is because counselors want to help their clients reach their goals. I think counseling does help people. It helps by giving you tools that can be used in everyday life to improve your relationships. This can help you feel better about yourself and others. Counseling can help people in many ways. It gives you new tools and skills that you can use to help yourself. It also gives you a new perspective on life. It can help you to see things in a different way. You can learn to better understand yourself and others. It can also help you to work through issues that are currently affecting your life. Counseling can help in many ways and I believe it is a great way to help people. :) I am a Licensed Professional Counselor in Texas.

It takes me a long time to fall asleep; I’d estimate about two hours. I often have nightmares, starting with being eaten by a monster, and I often wake up frightened and unable to breathe. I believe I started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of 8 years. Also, my father’s business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition. I was under a lot of stress, and life lost meaning. After improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress, my symptoms improved. However in the past couple months, I started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning. How can I solve this issue?

I am a teenager, and my brother is a few years older. He has a girlfriend who is always with him. He never hangs out with me anymore. We were really close, and it is making me really sad.
"Hi there, I can tell that you are struggling with this because it sounds like it is getting to a point where it is affecting you emotionally. It is perfectly normal to have disagreements with your sibling and it is something that happens in most families. One thing I would like to suggest is to try and talk to him about it and see if you can work out a compromise or a time where you can hang out. If that doesn't work out, you could see a professional to see if there is anything they can help you do to bridge this gap. For example, maybe you could do some kind of activity together that they would enjoy and they could teach you something they like to do. I wish you the best!

After I told them, they yelled at me.
Your parents have every right to be upset. It sounds like they did not handle this well at all. It is good that you are able to tell them, but I would try not to bring this up when you are trying to have a discussion about something else. When they yell at you, it is hard to know what they are thinking. Hopefully you can find someone who can help you through this. You might want to think about how you are feeling, and if you would like to talk to someone about that. It is also important to realize that some parents will handle it better than others. You may want to keep that in mind and try to not let it influence how you feel about your parents. If you can find a supportive adult, it would be a good idea to talk about this with someone. Hope this was helpful.Be well.

If I tell him I don't like certain things, he does when it pertains to me. He tells me it's not like that. He never has anything to say about me until I tell him something about himself.
"It's not unusual for people to have a ""double standard"" in their behaviour towards their partners. This is where the rules are different for them and not for their partners. It might be helpful to question whether your husband is seeing things in your relationship that you aren't. If so, it's possible that he views you as the perfect wife and that he needs to ""correct"" you in order to feel loved. But, he might be lacking in expressing his love to you and that's where the problem lies. Have you told him how much you appreciate how he goes above and beyond to make you happy?

It's been almost a year since my ex-boyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me many times. I had found out about a month before, but I hadn't told him I knew because I didn't want us to break up. I used to have very low self-esteem, and I think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic. My father cheated on my mother when I was little. I wonder if this pain has to do with that. My ex-boyfriend and I were only dating for five months, but I still can't get over this betrayal. I'm not sure what to feel to get over it: forgiveness? Hate? He helped me financially after our break up by lending me $3000, so I'm grateful for that. I still hate him for what he did and still want him to like me although we're not even talking anymore. We follow each other on Instagram and that's it. I feel like I still need his validation. This is haunting me day and night. I want to focus on my new relationship and goals, but I keep obsessing over this and keep checking my ex-boyfriend's Instagram and Facebook. I feel so bad and keep having nightmares.
I am glad you are seeing the importance in letting go of this relationship. Have you considered speaking with your ex-boyfriend and asking him to please give you his perspective?

Ever since I was little, I loved the idea of loving someone and spending my whole life with them. I treated everyone nice. For girls I liked, I would spend every second with them. It always ends the same way: “I like you as a friend,” or “I love your attention but not you.”
It sounds like you have already figured out that being in a relationship is not the right path for you. You might be happy spending time with your friends, which is the perfect way to spend time with them. I agree that this message repeats itself over and over, so it is possible that there is someone in your life that you are trying to win over. If you are not able to reach this person, it is OK. It might help to know that there are many people who share your thoughts and feelings about wanting a relationship. I encourage you to surround yourself with positive people and try not to focus on what you cannot have. There is plenty of good stuff in life that you can have without having a relationship.If you are still wanting to find the right person, consider becoming more clear on your own values and what you want in a partner. Also, look at your own wants and fears. You can learn a lot about yourself by looking at these things. Once you are able to look at your fears and understand them, you can become stronger and know what is truly important to you. I suggest looking at other relationships in your life and seeing what you like about those relationships. It may also be helpful to go on a date with a friend. You can learn a lot about yourself and the other person on a date. We often do things we do not like because we think it will make us like something else. On a date, try to focus on the good aspects of the other person and not notice the negative things. Have fun!I encourage you to find out what you want and how you can be happy. It might take some time, but it will happen.I hope that you find what you are looking for!Robin J.

I found out my boyfriend takes anti-depression medicine. Lately he's been saying he has a lot on his mind, and he needs time to think about us. We've only been dating 3 weeks but I like him a lot.
Is there a specific reason why you and the boyfriend only have been dating three weeks?Is there a reason you would feel so strongly about someone in three weeks that you would want to continue dating them?Often, what people mean is that they like the boyfriend, but if there is no obvious problem in the couple, then it may be wise to give the two of you more time to see how compatible you two are.It may also be that the boyfriend is having a lot of thoughts about the relationship, because he himself doesn't know what to think.When a person is feeling sad or troubled, it is often difficult for them to talk about their feelings. The person may be shy to the point of not wanting to talk about how they feel, or the person may be expecting a response from the other person that they would like to hear. If you tell the boyfriend you're feeling hurt or puzzled by his recent behavior, it is possible he will feel that you're expecting him to give you a clear and immediate answer, and so will shy away from talking about himself. If you both continue dating, then it is important that you both have the ability to talk about what is on your mind, even if the answer is something that you disagree with.In the future, if you feel that you feel strongly enough about a person to want to see them as a boyfriend, then you can say something like, ""I really like you, but I'm not sure what we're doing. I feel hurt and I'd like to talk about it, but I'm not sure how to do that. What do you think?""Also, it may be that the three weeks together so far are a reflection of the boyfriend's willingness to be open with you.In any case, it may be a good idea for the two of you to talk so that you both understand each other better, and that you each have an idea of what you expect from the other person.I hope this helps. Good luck to you both. :) ~Alexandra Myers, LMHCwww.stroked.comwww.stroked.comwww.stroked.comwww.stroked.comwww.stroked.comwww.stroked.comwww.stroked.comwww.stroked.comwww.stroked.comwww.stroked.comwww.stroked.comwww.stroked.comwww.stroked.comwww.stroked.comwww.stroked.

I've worked with this guy for about three years now, and I knew the first time I saw him that I was attracted. Over time, he became a very dear friend, and we talked about our relationship problems, family, dreams, and so on. There was always flirtation with us, and one day pretty recently, it progressed to making out. We agreed to keep it quiet, and we did, but in the back of my mind, I hoped it would become something more. It didn't, and three months later, I'm still not over it. I'm trying so hard to maintain the friendship because that's what he wants. We're no longer in the same office, which I thought would help me get over these feelings, but we still talk about work, and he's constantly touching me, so I'm still very drawn to him. He's a hugger and such a sweet guy, so I find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be, but he's clearly not interested. He's younger than me and prefers model types, but I see him checking me out a lot, which gives me hope. How do I get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship?
How you handle this situation is the most important thing. You say that you are trying to maintain the friendship because your colleague (your crush) wants you to. Are you going to give in to this pressure? What if you are able to say no. Maybe you could request to be sent to a different office. Or maybe you could not talk to him about this in a way that tells him you are receptive to his feelings. You need to be in control of this situation. You don't say how old you are but i would assume that you are an adult and you can do whatever you want. Your job and your crush's job is to respect you and what you want and if he is not willing to do that then you have every right to end this relationship. There is no magic pill for this, you need to figure out what is best for you. Best of luck!

I don’t deny them a relationship with their dad, but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core. I’m not sure how to handle this.
First off I want to say that it is okay to feel whatever it is that you are feeling. Many people don't feel that they are crazy because they are able to separate themselves and see that what the others are doing is different from them. It is normal to want the best for your kids and it is also normal to want to set boundaries for your kids and what is best for them. Parents in your situation may have different opinions of what is best for their children. In the end, kids are kids and they will do what they want to do. You are still their mom and they need you to be a mom. I am not sure if you have talked to your ex about what is going on with you or not, but maybe that is an option that you could talk to him about. I know that you have sacrificed a lot for your children and I am sure that they appreciate that. I am not sure what the outcome of this situation is, but I do know that you can still be a loving mom and set boundaries for them. You can help them have a relationship with their dad, but you can also make sure that it is on your terms and that you have control over how and when you interact with him. If you can keep yourself healthy and happy that could also help you to be a better parent to your kids. If you are not happy being called crazy, then perhaps you can send them a message that shows that you love them and you are a loving mom that is protecting their motherly instincts for them.I hope that you can make it through this difficult time. Maybe you can find some support from others in a local Mothers of Multiples group. Good luck!

It's not entirely true to say I enjoy being sad, but I always find a way to feel that way. I listen to sad music, read tragic stories, and, in a twisted way, like how bad it makes me feel. I focus on negative aspects of my life even if they aren't legitimate or I just make it seem negative.
"I would start by looking at what is keeping you feeling sad. Is there someone in your life that you feel sad around? Are there specific things that you are looking at in the world that are making you sad? What are you missing in your life? What is missing that you may not even realize that you are missing? What can you do to start feeling happier? Then, can you do it on your own and if so, how long will it take? You may need some help with this and I suggest checking out a professional therapist. I hope this helps. Best of luck to you."Cassandra"Cassandra,I appreciate your question and I'm glad you are seeking some insight into why you find yourself feeling so sad. It is important to dig deep into why we feel sad, what we are missing and what it is that we are missing. The next step is to look for ways to find happiness again. This is where therapy comes in. It can be hard to start feeling happy again by ourselves. Sometimes we need to look at what is missing from our lives. For example, you said that you listen to sad music. What are you trying to achieve by listening to sad music? What is the feeling you are trying to achieve? Is that how you want to feel? Maybe you need to listen to happy music in order to feel happy. It all depends on your situation. I don't know you, but I see that there is something sad in your life, but I see something else as well. I see someone looking for happiness, but they may not know how to get there. It is a slow journey and you will have to make some mistakes along the way in order to learn. The key is to be patient and learn from your mistakes. Good luck!

"I keep having these random thoughts that I don't want. Things like ""you aren't worth anything."" I know they're my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it. What is wrong with me, and how can I stop having these thoughts?"
"It may be helpful to recognize that these thoughts are your thoughts and it is you who is in charge of what you think.

I feel like I would be more comfortable as a girl even though I still like girls. I think I'm like a girl stuck in a guy body. I imagine myself as a girl too. I think this more because my friends say that if I was a girl I would be a hot looking one. And I don't care about having boobs or anything. I just feel like the way that I do act will make more sense if I was a girl.
"There is nothing wrong with you. You can be whatever gender you feel comfortable being. If you feel like your friends are pressuring you to ""be a hot looking one"" then maybe they are trying to make you feel better about yourself. You are unique and special just the way you are. If you have a feminine side you can embrace it and make it the most important part of who you are. If you have a masculine side you can embrace that too. The important thing is that you are comfortable with who you are and you can make your specialness the most important thing in your life. That means that no matter what you do you can make it special. Try this...when you catch yourself wishing you was a girl say to yourself, ""I love myself the way I am, I'm a guy, and I can be the best me that I can be no matter what I am. Now let's go be me, and make my specialness shine!

When I'm in large crowds I get angry and I just can't deal with people. I don't really like other people (I prefer animals) they make me nervous and scared. I lay awake at night thinking and having conversations in my head and i almost always end up making myself feel terrible and crying, I have more conversions in my head than I do with actual people. I don't know what's wrong with me and why I feel this way. What should I do?
You may be a very sensitive person. If so, then you need to honor your sensitivity and all the ways it manifests itself in your life. In large crowds?

"I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job. People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?"
"Anxiety attacks are actually quite common and for many people a daily experience.

My husband used a lot of negative words to hurt me, and I moved out. He is seeing a counselor and wants another chance to make things right. I'm not sure if I trust that he will not go back to his old ways.
If you're not able to trust your husband, you may be better off without him. If he is doing well in counseling, he will have a better chance of being a more attentive, present and loving partner. This may be possible if the two of you are working together to solve issues together in couples therapy. Remember, you can't change another person, but you can change your relationship with them. If you are able to trust him and he has been doing well in counseling, it may be helpful for you to work together with him in couples therapy to address your own insecurities and fears that caused you to leave. It may also be helpful for you to do your own counseling while he focuses on his progress in therapy.Best of luck to both of you!
