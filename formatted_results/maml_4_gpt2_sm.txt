I am so angry. I feel like the arguments with my parents have caused me so much anxiety and stress, and I don't know what to do. I want to sit down with a psychologist, but I cannot afford one, nor do I have my own health insurance.
Well, I would like to talk to your parents about what you feel about what you are experiencing.
=====
I don't know how to tell someone how I feel about them. How can I get better at expressing how I feel?
Well, I would suggest that you do something about it.
=====
How does a person start the counseling process?
I would ask that you do some research on how to talk to your counselor about what you feel you can and can't do in counseling.
=====
What are the basic skills a good counselor needs to have?
First, you have to understand that you are not alone.
=====
I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac. I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety.
I feel like you are not ready to talk to me about what you feel is wrong with your own body.
=====
I think I have depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and I have anger issues. I told my mom over and over again. She told me she would get me a therapist, but she never did.
I would talk to her about it.
=====
I have high functioning autism and I have been on a lot of dating sites like meet me, match, and zoosk. I haven't had any luck on any of the dating sites I have been on. I really want a boyfriend but I don't know what I should do.
Are you ready? You can't talk to yourself about it.
=====
I get really mad easily at my parents and family.
Are you okay?
=====
I had a dispute with my therapist regarding an appointment cancellation. Now, she is blocking me from seeing other psychologists at the same clinic (which takes my insurance), which is also where I get my psychiatric services. There is a strict 48 hour cancellation policy, and my appointments are at 3:00 on Tuesday.
Are you able to talk to your therapist? Your therapist: Yes.
=====
I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?
I'd like to talk to you about what you're going through, but I'd like to talk to you about what you're going
=====
My ex-boyfriend and I met over a year ago. We hit it off and fell in love pretty quick. However, he has trust issues and assumed I was cheating.
Are you a good friend? You're not a good friend.
=====
My dad beat and mentally abused me so badly that I can't function properly. Letting go of the past is important to moving on and getting better, but I’m terrified to get better because I don't even know who I am without the trauma. I've never gotten to be myself.
You're not going to get to be yourself, and you're not going to get to be yourself.
=====
I am always arguing with my father. He gets stressed over work and health and talks to me in a tone of voice that seems very demanding and seems more like yelling. I get upset often at this.

I am having a problem with extended family members who are inappropriately urinating in my home. They are peeing in cat litter boxes, bottles, and directly on floors and in corners of my house. Is there any literature that supports why such adults would behave this way?
I do not know if you can provide a specific example of what you mean, but I would suggest that you do a little research on this topic.
=====
I get angry and act out. It scares my wife and child.
You're not going to be able to talk to your kids about it.
=====
Hello, I have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled, insecure, and frustrated during her stay here in the city. I know she comes from a place of love, but she has always been short-fused and highly temperamental if something doesn't work out the way she planned it. I have tried my best to coordinate plans with her, but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication I seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include: inconsiderate, negative, oblivious, and self consumed.
Are you a good person?
=====
I'm an adult, facing problems with my mom. She's way too controlling. She decides things for me, disregarding whatever I say.
You're not going to be able to talk to your mom about what you're going through.

I'm a teenage girl. I don't know if I'm straight, bisexual, or gay. I've been straight all my life, but a sudden rush of questions have come over me, and I don't know anymore.
Are you a lesbian? You're not a lesbian, but you are a lesbian.

What do I do if I have been feeling like I could never be with anyone because no one would want me. Or I couldn't have many friends because of who I am. It's strange I want to be loved but I'd hate to be because I always lose.
I would love to be with someone who is your friend, but I'd hate to be with someone

What should I do when we see each other?
I'd like to talk to you about this.

My partner seems to always get depressed over the fact that his kids have to see and go through the divorce process. It’s especially when the mother of his kids keeps making him feel bad and using the kids as an excuse to get back at him. I feel like just telling him to go back with his family and forget about me.
Are you okay with that? You're not going to talk to your kids about it.

My suppose-to-be father told me to go find my real dad. We haven't been getting along since I was a teenager. If I said one thing that he thought was wrong, I always got degraded.
Are you a good dad? You're not a good dad, and you can't do it.
=====
I have always wanted to have a transition from male to female for some time now. This issue has persisted for 10 years already but I don't know where to start. I do not have the soundest information either.
Are you happy with your choice? You can talk to your partner about it.
=====
I was kidnapped at fourteen and raped at gunpoint. The guy got six months. When the same thing happened with two "friends" at nineteen, I didn't even report it.
Are you a good guy? You're a good guy, but you're a bit too much of a coward to do anything about it.
=====
My girlfriend was abused as a child. Now, if I hug or touch her in any kind of way she says she feels as if she is being abused as a child. What might be going on?
I am not a normal person and I do not like to
