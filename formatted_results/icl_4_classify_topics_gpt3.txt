You should try to find a counselor who can help you explore these doubts and feelings. You can also consider talking to a faith counselor or priest to get guidance.

My therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here. However, my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends. I have loaned money to him many times, and he always paid me back. I had a medical emergency last weekend and I was heavily medicated. I knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me, but this therapist dropped me off and never came again.
Hello. You have raised some very valid concerns in regards to your therapist's behavior. If you are not comfortable with this therapist, then you should find another one. You should also be cautious about who you allow into your personal life, as they may not be someone you would want to disclose important personal information to.

My spouse decided he no longer wanted me six years ago. Things have deteriorated so badly that we have separated but still live in the same house. He says he despises the sight of me, wants to be with other women, and divorce. What I don't understand is that he says constantly that I have no feelings for him and gets absurdly jealous if I speak to another male. Why does he constantly do these behaviors?
Hi, I don't know what to say. These are really difficult questions and I wish I had more answers for you. From what you have said, it sounds like your husband may be feeling a lot of intense anger and resentment towards you. I'm sorry that you are going through this.

My brother has been a heroin addict for years, and he’s now in his mid-30s. He has taken from me my mom and my grandparents. He's sick in the head. Now he moved his girlfriend into the house because they both manipulated us. Today, my mom and my brother went toe-to-toe over his girlfriend not helping around the house and always being high.

I want to know what I can do about it. My family is against transgender people and don't want anything to do with them. I want to be “me.” I feel as if I'll be happy then.
I understand how you feel. It can be really difficult to come out to your family and tell them that you want to transition. They might not be supportive and might not want anything to do with you. It is important to remember that you are allowed to be you and that you deserve to be happy. You can find support through transgender organizations or by talking to a counselor.

I have bipolar II disorder, I'm addicted to alcohol and weed, and I'm hopeless. I keep drinking even though it's harming myself and others.
Hi, and thanks for reaching out. It sounds like you are struggling a lot and it's tough when we feel like we can't control our lives. Alcohol and other drugs can play a big role in our bipolar disorder and addictions. When we drink or use drugs, we are often looking for a way to deal with the emotional pain we are feeling.It can be really hard to admit that we need help and that we need to stop drinking and using drugs. When we are battling addiction, it can be hard to make the decision to get help. There are a lot of resources out there, like Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous, and it may be helpful to talk to someone about your situation. It's really important that you don't give up on yourself. You are worth it.

On the first day of school I wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like I had bigger boobs. I did that the whole school year and my parents never found out. But now I can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest. How do I fix this?
It sounds like you're feeling ashamed of your body and worried about what your friends and family might think. Your anxiety is likely stemming from the fact that you feel like you're not good enough. You need to start by accepting yourself for who you are and what you have. You're not the only person in the world who has boobs and you're not the only person who has a body. You should be proud of your body and your boobs. You should also be proud of the fact that you're able to be comfortable in your own skin. You can start by hanging out with your friends and family without worrying about what anyone might see. You should also be honest with them about what's going on and tell them that you're insecure about your body. They'll be supportive and understanding.

I'm a female in my mid 20s. Lately I tend to over drink and I've become a very angry drunk. In the past, I have even cheated on my boyfriend while I was under the influence of alcohol. But now, even if I don't do anything wrong and don't embarrass myself, I still feel really guilty after a night of drinking. I don't understand why I'm feeling this way.
Alcohol can increase feelings of guilt, shame, and remorse. It's important to remember that these emotions are normal and are a result of the drinking. It's also important to remember that alcohol doesn't make the bad decisions you made any better. It's important to seek help and talk to someone about your drinking, so you can learn how to manage it in a healthy way.

I know that I need to get past my feelings for this person I fell in love with, but t's so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings I've never felt before. I feel like I don't want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, I know I need to be without him. I can't discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered "wrong" by a lot of people. How can I get myself to just move on?
It sounds like you are feeling a lot of conflicting emotions. It can be difficult to move on when we have strong feelings for someone, but we need to do what is best for ourselves. Here are a few things to think about and consider: 1. What is the reason you fell in love with this person? Was it based on qualities that you found attractive, or was it because of some other reason? 2. What are your thoughts about the conditions of your love? Are they acceptable to you? 3. How do you feel about staying in a relationship where the conditions are not met? Are you willing to put up with those conditions? 4. What do you think would be best for you in the long run? Do you think it is possible to move on and be happy in a different situation? 5. Are you willing to talk about this with somebody? A therapist can help you work through these difficult feelings and make a decision that is best for you.

The past always feels much brighter and more beautiful than my present. Everything about what's gone feels so amazing; almost like I'm high off nostalgia. But in the end it just makes me feel sadder knowing that all of the memories (and a close friend that left me) are gone forever. How do I move past that and live more in the present?
This is a really difficult question. As somebody who has experienced loss, it is really hard to not focus on the past. I get that you feel like the past is better and that it is all gone, but I think that you need to start by looking at the present. Take some time to reflect on what your present feels like. What are your thoughts? What are your feelings? What are your activities? What are your hobbies? What are your relationships like? Are they healthy? Are they fulfilling? Once you have a good understanding of your present, you can start to think about how to move forward. I think it is really important to remember that the past does not have to be a completely positive experience. It is okay to feel sadness and regret about the past. It is okay to want to remember the good times, but also be okay with letting go of the bad times. In the end, I believe that the most important thing that you can do is to keep moving forward. You will eventually reach a point where you will be able to look back on your past and see it for what it was- a time that you were growing and learning.

I was in a relationship with a woman for four years. We both made mistakes, but I do love her. She has moved in with another lady. I think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her. How can I find out for sure?
It's difficult to know for certain what is going on in another person's heart. However, if you are feeling that she is cheating on you to make you feel closer, it may be a sign to look into your relationship more closely.It is possible that she is feeling neglected and is using this other woman as a way to feel closer to you. This doesn't mean that she doesn't love you, it just means that she is struggling with how she feels about you.Talk to her about your feelings and see if she is willing to talk about the issue more openly. If she is not willing to talk, it may be best to end the relationship.

What can I do to stop grieving my mother’s death? When I am awake I just cry every day. I don't have anyone to talk to. I need help; I am still cry over her. Will I ever stop crying?
Grieving is a natural and healthy process. It is common to feel sad, lonely, and angry after someone dies. There is no one right way to grieve, and it will vary from person to person. You may find support in a bereavement group or talking with a counselor.

I like getting attention from men. I don't have sex. I lead them on to thinking I might want to. I like to tease, I like for men to chase me, and I like to feel wanted.
This is a difficult question to answer without knowing more about your personal history and motivations. From what you've described, it sounds like you might have some issues with self-esteem and attachment. It may be that you are looking for a sense of control or power in your relationships, and sex is one way to achieve this. It's also possible that you enjoy the thrill of the chase and the feeling of being wanted. If this is the case, it might be helpful for you to explore why you want these things and whether or not they are actually fulfilling for you. Additionally, it might be helpful for you to consider why you feel the need to tease and lead men on. Do these behaviors make you feel good in some way? Are you able to enjoy the interaction without these tactics? These are all questions you might want to explore with a therapist/counselor.

This can be a difficult decision, but it may be the best way for you to heal.

How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?
Hi there, thanks for your question.One of the things I value most is honesty. So, I will be honest with you.There is no easy answer when it comes to this question.Part of the problem is that often we don't really know ourselves very well.We often don't have all the facts and data. We make assumptions and then we second guess ourselves. Often, what we think is best for us, is not always what is actually best for us.We can get so lost in our own head that we don't even know what is going on.Another part of the problem is that sometimes, endings are difficult.We may be in a relationship where we don't want to end it, but we may also be in a relationship where the other person wants to end it.It can be hard to know what is going on.Sometimes, the best thing to do is to wait and see what happens.If the other person wants to end the relationship, then it is probably best to end it.If the other person doesn't want to end the relationship, then it may be best to try to work things out.In any case, it is important to remember that you are not alone and that there are people who can help you make the decision that is best for you.

It may be difficult for you to hear this, but it is the truth.There may be hope but it will require both of you to be willing to work through your issues.

At school I get bullied about my weight and my ugliness and I have been bullied my whole life that I believe them. How can I stop thinking about them and don't let it get in my head?

It's been almost a year since my ex-boyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me many times. I had found out about a month before, but I hadn't told him I knew because I didn't want us to break up. I used to have very low self-esteem, and I think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic. My father cheated on my mother when I was little. I wonder if this pain has to do with that.
There is definitely some pain associated with your experience with your father's infidelity. It is possible that this pain has a genetic component and you may be more prone to experience similar pain in your relationships. It is also possible that your experience with your ex-boyfriend breaking up with you has contributed to your low self-esteem. It is important for you to understand that you are not alone in experiencing these feelings and that there is nothing wrong with you. You deserve to be happy and content in your life.

It's really difficult to make a decision like this when so much is riding on it. On the one hand, you have a strong emotional connection to your husband.

Ultimately, it's up to you whether or not you stay with your husband. However, it's important to remember that you're not the only person involved in this relationship. Your husband may have a different story than what you've been told. You need to be sure that you have all of the facts before making any decisions.

My roommate has had a drinking problem for a while. She goes out, gets trashed, and then expects everyone to take care of her. The next morning, she apologizes constantly until she feels validated. She also thinks everyone hates her all the time. If I don't seem anything other than happy, she asks me "Do you hate me?

Your wife may have been feeling this way for a while and she may have decided that it is now the best time for her and her daughter.

Hi, and thank you for your question. When it comes to the types of questions you are asking, it is generally acceptable to ask someone about their education and job. However, it is important to be thoughtful about the questions you ask. Questions such as "did you like your classes?" or "do you have a lot of fun at work?" can be intrusive and can be seen as nosy. It is also important to be aware of the fact that people often share more personal information when they are comfortable with the person they are talking to. When you are interested in someone, try to take the time to get to know them better.

I'm always told I'm not good enough or trying hard enough. I put 100% in to every thing. I'm worn out, I've worked on all of my family relationships, I'm doing great in school, I'm kind to those in need and otherwise. I stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so I don't have to make as many and the ones I do I learn from. Somehow it's still not good enough and nothing I do works.
I'm sorry you feel this way. You are doing an amazing job! It sounds like you have put a lot of effort into making your life the way you want it to be. You deserve to be proud of yourself.

After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now he is depressed and hopeless again.
Sounds like your client has had a roller coaster of emotions since their hospital discharge. It's natural for people to go through a range of emotions after a traumatic experience like this. Sometimes people feel wonderful and happy for a short period of time, only to relapse into depression or feeling hopeless. It can be difficult to know what to do when someone goes through a fluctuation in emotions like this. One thing you can do is to be there for your client, listening to them and offering support.Also, it's important to remember that everyone experiences emotions differently and there is no one right way to feel. Sometimes people need time to adjust to the changes that have taken place. Sometimes people need to talk about what is going on. Sometimes people need to do something physical to help them feel better. It's important to be patient and understanding during this time.

I'm depressed. I have been for years. I hide it from everyone because I'm scared of the reactions I'll get. Last time I tried telling my parents, it was a huge argument about me being too young to be depressed (I’m a legal adult), calling me ungrateful, and telling me that if I can't handle things now, it's only going to get worse in the future (which is turning out to be true). It's exhausting pretending to be okay, and I don't know how much longer I can try.
It sounds like you are trying really hard to be "okay", and it's taking a lot of energy. It sounds like you are carrying a lot of guilt and shame, and that's really tough to carry around. It sounds like you feel like you have to be strong for everyone else, and that's not fair. It's okay to let someone know that you are struggling, and you don't have to be strong all the time. Talking about your feelings can make a lot of difference in how you feel.

It sounds like you may have some depression, anxiety and Misophonia, which can all make it difficult to feel motivated. It can be helpful to talk to someone about how you are feeling and see if there is anything that can be done to help.

I'm a young adult woman, and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home. This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why.
Sexual activity between two people who are in a relationship is typically seen as a way to strengthen the relationship. This is not always the case, however. It is possible that your religious beliefs influenced your decision to have sexual intercourse with your boyfriend, even though you were not comfortable with it. It is also possible that your religious beliefs led you to believe that you were obligated to have sexual intercourse with your boyfriend because you were dating.You may find it helpful to talk to a counselor about your experiences. A counselor can provide you with support, guidance, and resources to help you understand why you acted the way you did and how to deal with these feelings in a more productive way.

Make sure to take some time for yourself before these gatherings so that you aren't feeling so overwhelmed. 2. It can be helpful to talk to someone about your nightmares. A therapist can help you work through the nightmares and any underlying anxiety. 3. It is also important to remember that you are not alone.

My husband told me last year he never loved me and should have never married me. He's been talking about divorce, but he hasn't filed. Now he has a girlfriend and he abandoned me and his kids. He has no financial help, and he has been out of the home for four months. He became very angry and mean.
This sounds incredibly painful and frightening. Your husband's abandonment is likely the result of his emotions being triggered. If you are able to reach out to a support group or counselor for help, it would be a great step in healing. Additionally, seeking legal help may be a good next step. This is a time where you need to be as vocal as possible in order to protect yourself and your family.

The past always feels much brighter and more beautiful than my present. Everything about what's gone feels so amazing; almost like I'm high off nostalgia. But in the end it just makes me feel sadder knowing that all of the memories (and a close friend that left me) are gone forever. How do I move past that and live more in the present?
This is a difficult question to answer. I think that it is important to learn how to live in the present moment and not dwell on the past. Doing this will help you to avoid negative emotions like sadness and nostalgia. Additionally, it is helpful to have a support system. Talking to friends and family about your experiences can help you to process them and move on.

My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the "straight and narrow" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others. His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?
Hi. I think it would be helpful to explore with your fiancé why he feels so negatively about your past. Is it something that he has personal experience with? If so, that might be an easier conversation to have. From what you've said, it sounds like he might have some unresolved issues that he's bringing up in your relationship. It sounds like he might need some time to process his feelings and come to terms with them. In the meantime, it might be helpful to give him some space and try to focus on the present. Some things you could do to help include: Spending time together without talking about your past, Spending time together doing activities that he enjoys, Making time for yourselves when he's struggling to let go, and Appreciating his willingness to work on the relationship.

My therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here. However, my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends. I have loaned money to him many times, and he always paid me back. I had a medical emergency last weekend and I was heavily medicated. I knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me, but this therapist dropped me off and never came again.
Hello and thank you for your question.I am sorry to hear that you have had a negative experience with your therapist. It sounds like he may have been exploiting a personal relationship for financial gain. Therapists are not allowed to take advantage of their clients in any way. If you have loaned money to him, you should contact the credit card company and dispute the charge. Additionally, you may want to consider reporting this to the authorities. There may be laws that protect you in this situation.Thank you for reaching out.

She said she needed space after three days of dating, and she got a boyfriend a week later. I still really miss her, and she told me she still likes me.
It is possible that she still likes you and didn't want to hurt your feelings. If she still likes you and wants to be friends, be respectful of her feelings and let her know you are still interested. If she doesn't want to be friends, that is also okay. You may not be the best match for her, but that doesn't mean she doesn't like you.

This creates a cycle of sadness and loneliness because you don't feel like you can reach out to anyone for support. I would recommend talking to a therapist or counselor to help you work through your feelings and address the obstacles in your life that have contributed to your current state. Talking openly and honestly is one of the most helpful things you can do to manage your emotions.

This will help you to connect with them more objectively.

Do I have the rights to be able to sign my brother into mentalhealth facility?
Hi there, and thanks for reaching out for help. It sounds like you are dealing with a lot, and I completely understand. In regards to your brother, it would be in his best interest to be hospitalized for his mental health.

You may also want to speak to a lawyer to get more information on your specific situation.

My spouse decided he no longer wanted me six years ago. Things have deteriorated so badly that we have separated but still live in the same house. He says he despises the sight of me, wants to be with other women, and divorce. What I don't understand is that he says constantly that I have no feelings for him and gets absurdly jealous if I speak to another male. Why does he constantly do these behaviors?
I think it is fair to say that your spouse feels some level of anger, resentment, and hurt. If you were to ask him directly why he behaves this way, I'm guessing he would say that he doesn't want to be in a relationship where you are the only one who loves him.From your description it sounds like he may feel that he is losing control and that he is not able to protect you.This can be a very difficult situation for both of you.You may want to consider seeing a therapist who specializes in marriage or couples counseling. Often times couples therapy can help individuals identify and work through the issues that are causing tension and difficulties in the relationship.

This is a difficult question. On one hand, counselors are ethically bound to protect the confidentiality of their clients.On the other hand, counselors may feel that it is in the best interest of their clients to end their sessions. Ultimately, the decision to end a session or terminate working with a client is a personal one that each counselor makes on a case-by-case basis.

I'm a female in my mid 20s. Lately I tend to over drink and I've become a very angry drunk. In the past, I have even cheated on my boyfriend while I was under the influence of alcohol. But now, even if I don't do anything wrong and don't embarrass myself, I still feel really guilty after a night of drinking. I don't understand why I'm feeling this way.
It is understandable that you are feeling guilty after drinking, given that your drinking has led to problems in the past. Alcohol can be a potent way to cope with stress, and in this case, it may be serving to amplify your feelings of guilt. It is also possible that your guilt is related to your feelings of anger. When you're drinking to excess, you may be using alcohol to numb your emotions and to escape from your troubles. This can leave you feeling empty and guilty, as you are no longer able to address the issues that are causing you stress. If you are able to address the underlying issues that are driving your anger, you may find that your guilty feelings dissipate.

How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?
Counselors typically work with a client for a specific length of time, or until the goals of the session are met. Sometimes it is necessary for a counselor to end a session sooner for a variety of reasons, such as the client no longer meeting the goals of the session, or the counselor feeling that the client is no longer benefiting from the counseling.

How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?
Counselors are generally passionate about helping people, but at the same time, they must protect the client's best interests. When it is determined that the client is not benefiting from counseling or when the client refuses to cooperate with treatment recommendations, then it is in the counselor's best interest to end the session.

I feel like every time I do something someone asks me to, I never fully meet what they want. I feel that when I finish it, they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it. I feel like they just want nothing to do with me.
Hello, and thank you for your question. It can be really difficult to feel like we're not good enough, especially when we feel like we're trying so hard. It sounds like you feel like you're always giving something to those around you, but they never seem to appreciate it enough. It can be really tough to try to meet others' expectations, but it's important that you don't stop trying. Sometimes it's helpful to think about why those expectations are there in the first place. Sometimes people might want you to do something because they think it will help them, or it might be something that is important to them. However, it's also important to remember that you should do what feels good to you. If you feel like you're not able to meet someone's expectations, it might be a good idea to talk to them about it. They might be able to understand and appreciate your feelings a little better that way.

I'm a female in my mid 20s. Lately I tend to over drink and I've become a very angry drunk. In the past, I have even cheated on my boyfriend while I was under the influence of alcohol. But now, even if I don't do anything wrong and don't embarrass myself, I still feel really guilty after a night of drinking. I don't understand why I'm feeling this way.
It is understandable that you are feeling guilty after drinking. Alcoholics often feel this way because alcohol is a drug that alters our thinking and feelings. It can also make us feel more connected to people and things that are not really worth caring about.Your guilt may be a result of the way alcohol is affecting your brain. This is why it is important to get professional help to address the underlying causes of your drinking, so you can learn to manage these feelings in a healthy way.

On the first day of school I wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like I had bigger boobs. I did that the whole school year and my parents never found out.

I'm a Christian teenage girl, and I have lost my virginity. My boyfriend is a Christian teenager too, but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner. I planned to abstain from sex but I guess I wasn't clear about this because I was also tempted and led him on. We continued to have sex. Does it mean that he isn't the one God planned for me?
Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for people to lose their virginity outside of an exclusive, monogamous relationship. It sounds like you two had a lot of fun, and it's possible that you both enjoyed it. If you want to continue to be friends and see each other, that's okay. However, if you are still feeling confused or uneasy about the whole situation, it might be helpful to talk to someone who can offer impartial advice and support.
