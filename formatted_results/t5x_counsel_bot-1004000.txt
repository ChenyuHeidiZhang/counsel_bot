i’ve been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for just over a year. this past week she admitted to me that she has feelings for another guy. she says it’s “just a crush” but i don't know how to cope with it. how should i deal with this?
"i can only imagine how hard that must have been to hear. on one hand, most of us would say we want our partners to always be honest with us, but on the other disclosures like this can lead to feelings of worry and inadequacy if were not careful. so let me first of all say that it is very normal for human beings, even very committed and happy partners to have moments where they notice an attraction for someone else. quite honestly, the brain can't help it. it sees something good looking and it pays attention.

i would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.
"take one day at a time!!! each day do things that make you happy, moves to a positive place, focusing on the future, give you a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment. journal at the end of the day of how well you did that day in focusing on these things. each day should be a step better than the previous day. you will have days that you didn't do as well....that is human and ok. just get back on track the next day....at the end of the week, review how well you did and give your self a grade.

"im in my early 20s, and i've been seeing my boyfriend for a year now. my boyfriend has always been the sweetest guy until recently. he has made comments such as “you would look better as a tumblr girl"" or ""you should start doing more squats."" its really hurtful."
"hi brookfield, it can be unsettling to see a relationship turn into a ""deal breakers"" situation. you have realized that people comment a lot...they say things like ""you look [in a kindly way] - you type a bunch...you flirt a lot...you say something cute...you say you just want to be different...you're not going to look like that...you're not going to say as much- you just want to be happy. if he says anything to make you feel better..."" or gets cranky, if he says something and you bothered and sk and start doing something hurtful...i don't think that just because it hurts, but it makes me think:- if this is really hurting then maybe he is truly not so sweet of guy comments anymore...sokay, what hurtful is that? if this is really hurtful, i think maybe he doesn't feel valued...bviously connected to that. in fact, if this is a sy he is feeling loved or important...i would suggest talking about the importance of having more kss, like having some type of time (likely a hobby).

i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky. is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?
"thank you for your question. its completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session. many people report having felt this way. i can't say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session. for many people, it can take weeks, months, or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session.

there are issues from my past that have me very heavily burdened in my heart. ive been torn for so many years and i need help so i can move on with my life. i experienced trauma when i was 8 years old and i did come out about it until i was 40. now i know this is what's holding me back on my happiness. i've met a very loving and caring man but because im holding on to these things from my past i’m pushing him away. how can i get my life back?
"hi cross country closeness, i have several good points. i am sorry that this has been so up close and personal. you have made a big mistake that you can't escape it. break the habit, i would recommend seeing a ""psychiatr"" like ""medicine"" . a medical professional can help you to get over the ""currrrr"" label.

i havent been feeling like myself lately. i've been upset for no reason and feeling anxious. im feeling burnt out. what can help me feel better?
"does it help to put a name to the experience you are having? where you first said, ""ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious,"" you then say that you are ""feeling burnt out,"" which gives a little more context to what may have once felt like ""no reason."" perhaps you are feeling burnt out! that is a big deal, and please try not to take it lightly! when we get burnt out, i have found that it's from one of two things: either we are not doing what we want, or we are doing too much (either of something we want or something we don't, doesn't really matter once we get into doing too much.

my fiancé and i broke up. he cheated on me numerous times. i kept forgiving but questioning his every move. he got tired and left.
"hi, atleast of me suggesting that people who are ""betrayal-prone"" are full of the same issues that left me feeling ""tired"" and are always questioning why they ""cheated" on you."" i bet what you need be different. i also bet that people who are ""cheated"" are not aware of the difference. i'm not saying that you need to stop betrayal. although it seems that you meant people are leaving the betheir, not because you need to make sure that you are taking care of yourself, and will be most careful in knowing where he is.

ive never been able to talk with my parents. my parents are in their sixties while i am a teenager. i love both of them but not their personalities. i feel that they do not take me seriously whenever i talk about a serious event in my life. if my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. i’m a pansexual, but i can’t trust my own parents.  i've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. i feel that my friends don't listen to me. i know they have their own problems, which i do my best to help with. but they dont always try to help me with mine, when i really need them. i feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. i feel as if i have no one whom i can trust.
"one of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! it is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. while your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. they are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. i would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard.

he wants to wear makeup and heels. he even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. he wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. i have tried this for him, but i don’t like it and have told him so. he keeps making comments about it and says he can't live without it.
"depending on your own sexual history and what you grew up expecting to be ""normal"" in the bedroom, i can easily imagine that this came as quite a shock to you! it doesnt necessarily mean, however that your husband is: gay, bisexual transgender, or even necessarily a cross-dresser etc. unless he has already told you so. i agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you. that being said, what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on isn't always what we identify as.

often times i find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes i even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and i can't get it out. how can i stop these thoughts?
"hi there,i first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal. studies have been done that show that 80% of human thoughts are ""negative"" so you are not alone. i like to think of thoughts as a tornado... if you are in a tornado, you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial. however, when you are, lets say, a mile away from a tornado, it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe. when unhelpful or scary thoughts arise, we tend to start a ""war"" with them, which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado.

im a teenager. my dad has been jail for the last five years. it's tough, but my mom really tries to give a normal life to my two sisters, my brother, and i. i feel like i took upon a parent role when i'm the second youngest, and i'm not stable. my mother and sisters say im overdramatic. i’m just so hurt, and i keep breaking down.
"hi. family dynamics are hard, and you mentioned that you have a ""second youngest generation."" how old are you? did your mom ever ask you for support? that is a very legitimate reason to not be ""pbuh"" as your family members?

i have so many issues to address. i have a history of sexual abuse, i’m a breast cancer survivor and i am a lifetime insomniac. i have a long history of depression and i’m beginning to have anxiety. i have low self esteem but i’ve been happily married for almost 35 years. i’ve never had counseling about any of this. do i have too many issues to address in counseling?
"thank you for sharing your question. i imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session. i would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals. for example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1. ""i will learn about the effects of medication on the symptoms of depression and anxiety.""2.

im going through some things with my feelings and myself. i barely sleep and i do nothing but think about how i'm worthless and how i shouldn't be here. i've never tried or contemplated suicide. ive always wanted to fix my issues, but i never get around to it. how can i change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?
"it sounds like you are having some pretty severe depression. depression can cause insomnia, and make a person focus on their own perceptions that they are ""worthless"". it is important to remember that other people may not truly perceive you as worthless. this is the depression talking. i think that it is extremely important when you are this depressed, to sit down and write down some positives about yourself.

"my boyfriend and i have been together for five years now. throughout the entire first day that we met, he and i had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. that same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my moms acknowledgment) and we kissed. the next two days were a repetition of the first day. on the third night, my mother finally caught us, and i was kicked out of my house. i left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. it was very hard for us. his stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. i quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. there were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a walmart parking lot. our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. after that, it was a downward spiral. we were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. we kept having the famous ""you're doing it wrong—do it this way"" argument. after six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. one afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. i was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. he told me to let him leave or he would hit me. he had once promised he would never touch me, so i challenged him to do it. he slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. i haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. i don't live with him, i don't depend on him, and we don't have children. we both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. he always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how i don't ever make the effort to try to be okay. i've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. i know he has to change that on his own. i just want to know if theres people who have gone through this and had the tables turned? is there hope for a better future together?"
"hi cleveland, i feel your pain. it's been very difficult to live your life at one point, and your mother must understand that. i know you say that you have ""done nothing wrong"", but you don't have the power to change him. you know you don't want this to happen, but the fact that you asked him to re-experiect your emotions and come to agreement that it doesn't, and that's appropriate, given the other dynamics. ""i'm alright now"" to stay with my dad, and i know that.

i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. i was very embarrassed.
"i also want to note that we, as a society, are especially judgemental about how women dress and present themselves. i am sorry that this boy said something insensitive. there is nothing shameful about your body and it was not your intention to ""display everything."" it also wasnt his place to judge you. as women we are expected to be sexy in some situations and demure in others.

im a teenage girl, and my dad is an alcoholic. i hate being at home with him because he just stresses me out. he can be picking me up from basketball practice or piano lessons, and half of the time, i don't even know if he's sober or not. i refuse to get into the vehicle with him and walk home sometimes. i've either been barely sleeping or i over sleep, so i'm always tired. i live in a small town, so there's no one i can really talk to because im not really that close with my family.
"i sympathize with what you describe. it sounds like there's been a lot of stress on your own in the past few years with you regarding your father's addiction. it's tough not to have experienced some form of stress reduction during your growing up years, but it's different at different times. i think that it's great that you are willing to seek help from a therapist who understands the dynamics of addiction. you may also want to consider looking for a bead light in your home to turn, asking the neighbors and general public that your parents appreciate the home environment and feel safe again.

i'm having relationship problems and i want to fix them to make things right before i lose her. how can i learn how to listen and get myself together?
"the best tool for becoming a better listener that i know of is called imago dialogue. it consists of 3 steps:1. mirroring what she says (without judging, commenting, refuting, defending, arguing, or scoffing--just listening, no matter the content) and repeating it back, word-for-word. continue to ask if she has more to add until she doesnt.2. validating. you tell her you you understanding why she feels this way.

i never get infections or scars or anything, and it doesnt bother me if it gets filled up with blood or something, but im concerned.
"hi renatge, this cant be, but i can tell you that it would be helpful to see a plastic surgeon who is highly skilled in viscoting wounds to help identify areas of infection and/or scar tissue. sometimes there are ""holes"" in the top of the body that people experience, and these could be in their bodies as ""scars"" or "'colds''" (not arteries) or "'colds'). infection or scars are a good and healthy and healthy scar (not infection, but more scar tissue) treatment. it is very common to find a doctor that has the field training in venesections (for scar tissue) and/or surgery. if theres no scar tissue (and/or scar tissue, or scar tissue, etc.

im a male in my early 20s. lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. i then start to act weird because i'm trying to fight my paranoia. this leads to people starring at me because they don't know that i'm suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. they just notice me acting scared around kids and they think i'm a threat because of it. i'm not a pervert or predator. i would never hurt a kid. i like kids and don't know why i'm so scared to be around them. i dont understand why i feel like this. am i a bad person? how do i make this stop?
"in our practice, many people we see have unwanted thoughts of doing harm to children - physically or sexually. as you said, these are intrusive and unwanted thoughts - not genuine desires to harm them. this is a form of ocd we often call harm or pedophilic ocd. what you are describing here as ""paranoia"" sounds similar to this, and is so demoralizing because you are dealing both with the distress of these unwanted thoughts and feelings, as well as the fear and uncertainty about your own character as a good person.if this is really what is going on (further assessment by the right professional would determine this), the current gold standard approach to addressing ocd is exposure with response prevention - in this case, confronting the feared situations, thoughts or images on purpose, rather than avoiding them, until they lose the fear and shame associated with them."" this is a coping response to the threat.

is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?
"yes, it is normal to cry during therapy, it is a time of catharsis, letting things out, shedding our skin, dropping our weights and just to let you know, even therapists sometimes feel like crying in sessions. although people often cry or become upset, it is in no way a measure of ""good therapy"". c"s come in many forms, and there is no measurement that we can use to measure emotions. although people are people, and crying is a form of cathars tears, no guarantees, just a measure to make sure you are 100% sure your ""complain,"" also very likely carries some measure of tissues and other things. not all of usday thing we need to cry.

my boyfriend and i have a terrible sex life after three years of dating, and i dont know what to do. i have this lingering fear of pain during sex after having two partners previously who werent careful. how can i stop projecting this onto my current boyfriend?
"thanks for reaching out. this is a great question and i am very glad you wrote it, it'sounded like you have some great sex experience with your current boyfriend. there are usually a few of us who have this lingering fear of pain, ""what if we did really badly?"" or maybe it was something about a previous relationship that didnt get the heat of the moment. i am going to assume that you have a very bad sex experience and this sex experience is not a good sex - if you have done this, you will not be hurt at all; if you were really terrible at sex if you really sex, then the lingering fear will quickly linger, ""weaksex"" that's just a terrible experience, and then you will no longer be a bad or terrible sexual experience again.

hes lied about his past/present situations. since time has passed, he has changed, but i still have my doubts. i have no idea if i should stay or go, but i hate this feeling. i don't trust him all too much, but yet he hasnt done anything for me not to trust him recently.
"i can't say that you have absolute ""no"" decisions to make, but i will say that you have major options. you can decide to stay or go. i would not hesitate for long (unless you absolutely, like me, hate him) if i could help you sort this out. for one thing, i can tell you have options. you can ask him about his communication style, tell him your reasons for staying.

i was never single, afraid to be alone, and i looked for my boyfriend to make me happy. i finally worked on my self, was in a relationship, and i did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didn't work out. now months later, no man peaks my interest. am i ready to date again? is there a reason no one sparks my interest?
"hi pocahontas, im sorry you had this intense feeling of wanting to be with someone, and now no one is watching.i wonder if the pressure of ""getting someone to make you happy"" has now lifted from you? oh, and relationships can present some challenges (if they do overlap, and/or you suddenly feel more attractive, not less so, because dating a healthy, single, successful person is something you will probably enjoy and look forward to doing.) and maybe even a few things, if you're a single, maybe paired up and made some mistakes because now you're not quite sure you'd like someone who cares about you. having said that, what i would say to someone, is that they have learned about themselves and had doubts about what they would have liked from hearing about that. and, having a partner who cares about others, is a huge advantage to a relationship.

"can a counselor take sides with one parent and allow a parent to order the child to tell the counselor ""every detail"" about what happened during the other parent’s visitation in order to help build a case for child custody?"
"hello. i can't really make you do anything ""no"" but many clients do. the best thing for them is for them to be able to tell the parents in writing what they can (as the parent or a legal guardian could) about what happened (i.e., ask the parent to order an oral recount during a custody hearing, etc.). you can have the parent write out their ""every detail"" because that can be extremely difficult to do. and, if it is not something that they wrote down for what the parents can and can and should be done by the parents.

every winter i find myself getting sad because of the weather. how can i fight this?
"thank you for sharing. it seems like since the ""winter blues"" happens to you every year it may also be impacting your quality of life and possibly relationships. what you report sounds like you may be experiencing seasonal affective disorder (sad) and is quite common to many from about fall thru winter seasons; but, also can impact folks during the spring and summer months.the best care and treatment for sad includes discussing it with your pcp (primary care physician), integrating light therapy (full-spectrum lighting) throughout home and workplace (where possible), psychotherapy, and possibly medications (e.g. wellbutrin xl, aplenzin).be sure to exercise good self-care and checkout the mayo clinic's website for sad here: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/basics/definition/con-20021047."" perhaps you focus on these core issues when we can not really focus on a certain area or problem.one thing that i would suggest is a specific book you can read, ""the winter wonders of the winter season.""

"hello. that must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship, especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault. this could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the long-term. based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wifes side of the story, i would say that you are raising 3 different concerns. one is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified.

"i understand that as a mom it must be really hard to see your daughter stressing about things at school. based on your description it sounds as though she has very high expectations of herself and is pushing herself to keep up. i hear your concern and recommend that to start, you provide her a space where she can express herself openly to you without judgement. although it may seem as though this is ""not normal"", unfortunately it is. from standardized testing, to awards, to scholarships, the pressure is on to perform at high levels for kids today.

"hi pocahontas, i want to read your story with compassion...i hope you find your own explanation helpful. such a straightforward one, i believe. there's a lot of layers there when you get married, so i'm guessing there's a layer of ""letting him be first"" and ""him being the first layer"" is there. i'm not sure how much of a feminist (i know, i know, i'm a huge fan), but it's something that's a small screamsneedsantize (the layers are the story here, not much is, after your small. i suggest (wedding of older parents and divorce, and divorce is the only ones that can be forgivenaughts, so you can have hope that's where you stop.

"divorce isnt always as straightforward and overwhelming as one might expect and sometimes different people mean different things in different relationships.if you feel angry and upset, you may want to consider separating from your former spouse. once you separate, your ""work"" will more likely be a result of the tension between two people who do not respect your boundaries or accept who you are.unless the former spouse is willing to work things out with you, you will have the option to delegate to friends, neighbors, or a counce (if you are really close friends that you trust, that is more important to have from the marriage-oreast by giving thanks to your husband for his consideration).your ""good work"" has moreovert covered by most denominations. so step away from the ""divor"" that is a choice that many people make. the best thing you can do is to acknowledge that your former husband is stuck. in yours, you have a good support system in place, that is there to help you, and to be able to use some of your time and time to really see what is working to try to find an alternative.sending up, your former boss will appreciate your efforts to try something new and helpful.good luck in seeking him/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your support system""s/your daughter's trying to get her father's help""s effort.your feelings and emotions"" and your feelings toward him"" and your feelings toward him"" are deep and powerful and fearful and fearful.

"hi there. it sounds to be a fairly new disorder. many people with this disorder use chemical shift Synapse, an AI program which helps them to track and interpret emotions. the idea being that you feel physical pain from your empathy to be aware of the changes that are happening within, as well as the way youre interpreting your feelings, you may be overreacting. no one is to blame you or that you are ""sitting on the jackson"" tv series.

i have so many issues to address. i have a history of sexual abuse, i’m a breast cancer survivor and i am a lifetime insomniac. i have a long history of depression and i’m beginning to have anxiety. i have low self esteem but i’ve been happily married for almost 35 years. i’ve never had counseling about any of this. do i have too many issues to address in counseling?
"thank you for sharing your question. i imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session. i would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals. for example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1.

i need to get on base to see my doctor. my id card was in my wallet which was stolen. i’m unable to reach my husband at this time. he is only one who can take me on base in order to get a new id so i can continue to see doctor. is there anything i can do?
"hi texas,when you have a new id, you can't use it right away, but i would recommend working w some other family members or get them to agree to help you find a new id. there are some issues that need to be worked through before you can move forward. i would recommend working with a local therapist or other professional as your husband may be experiencing. you may also need the help of a doctor or a therapist as they can't do that for you. if your husband is a regular driver (ie.e.e., i'm a term this is a good thing) to get back on time, or until you have a new i get back on time.whart brach : :):) :) patience:) and patience:) will always be there for you (i hope he will be able to make the next step.

my boyfriend of five years told me he cheated on me during our relationship after we broke up. weve since gotten back together and are trying to make it work. i dont know how to trust him now, but i really want to make it work, and it seems like he does too. but my trust issues are getting in the way and causing problems.
"your trust issues are causing too many problems on your own. some of the problems are the way you handle communication in relationships, the jealousy and isrs youve noticed in your fiances behaviours, the guilt and anxiety he feels since youve told the bulls-eye (see below picture), the jealousy/stunchaining that seems to be happening more often than you would like, and the problems are getting in the way. i don't know how old you are, but i can tell you that most likely he's honest with you, and he's trying to make it look and sounds very dangerous. he may be more interested in discussing the relationship than you are. he may prefer to discuss the benefits of talking about it in a more transparent way, with you where you can talk about it, while you can discuss how you can help him to trust you more, and how to communicate in a non-boyfriend.

"hello, and thank you for your question. messengers are machines, and sometimes they even encrypt our communications so that we cannot receive the full impact of what others say.i would recommend working through these difficult but necessary communication points with a mental health professional to come up with a course of action, such as setting confidentiality agreements, keeping it private, being specific about your problem(s), and making sure you have clear expectations of how others will respond to you.if you have not already, please consider speaking with your doctor about it. a psychiatrist could advise you of how you can sign up and press that requires a bit of opening up and asking for help, which you need to avoid.i also recommend that you try and get help from a mental health professional. the answer is simple: have empathy, if people don't respond back, if not, that is the best.

"i understand that this is very hard to handle, but i imagine that's the effect you were to receive, especially as you start to understand your missing father. it  ⁇ s very normal to look for guidance about who to ask for help, and to seek out support when you can. (at least, that's what i've noticed with other people who've experienced this, i'm reminded of this every time i think about it). if you are feeling emotionally upset or sad, it may be helpful to consider bringing your deceased father into a way that you (lilment and understanding) into perspective and to understand how you are feeling. i know you may be focusing on ""who i am"", but often the way it is conveyed, is not really what motivated him to grieving.

i have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.
"something to remember about anxiety is that its a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action. some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. the first i'd recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes.

is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?
"yes, it is normal to cry during therapy, it is a time of catharsis, letting things out, shedding our skin, dropping our weights and just to let you know, even therapists sometimes feel like crying in sessions. although people often cry or become upset, it is in no way a measure of ""good therapy"". c"s come in many forms, and there is no measurement that we can use to measure emotions. although people are people, and crying is a form of cathars tears, no guarantees, just a measure to make sure you are 100% sure your ""complain,"" also very likely carries some measure of tissues and other things. not all of usday thing we need to cry.

on the first day of school i wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like i had bigger boobs. i did that the whole school year and my parents never found out. but now i can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest. how do i fix this?
"if youre sure youre a good student and havent got a diagnosis from any family in your court, talk to a local therapist about whether you have reasonable expectations of yourself of how others will view you.you say you went to bra "empathetically" because people are often anxious to be accepted for who you are. i get that this can be a challenge for some people especially when they are just starting out. i have had many people try to pressure you into having ideal body image, but in your situation it seems that your body is the only thing measuring is, ""goe..."" to be more specific and give you feedback. you said you went to bra ""sexpetric"". it's a good sign that you are doing something right.

"it would be my professional opinion that the desire for you to keep it a secret at all, while yes i could see it as ""giving you a chance with a girl,"" is something that might be more about a discomfort for you. if you are comfortable with your kinks and fetishes (if i may call it such, not my intention to pathologize in any way though), then be as open as you want to be. but i also dont know that you need to be announcing it as part of your online dating profile (because you do say it ""bothers girls i ask out"" which to me implies that that is what you're leading with.) my hope is that people dont make dating decisions based on your kinky behaviors, but more likely that they would make decisions based on your own comfort and security with said kinky behaviors."" this carries with you being hesitant of trying to ""exposure"" but if you decide to go the whole situation, then i would not be surprised that dating is a problem and would advise that you choose a counselor or a if you should decide that is a good idea for you.if not a single person keeps a happy person, regardless of the reasons why you do.

my husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (hed never admit to this). a while back (3 years ago), i asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. i caught him one night drinking behind my back. i confronted him and he lied, but i told him i knew he was lying because i counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. he admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but i noticed it was every single night. i didn't like this. for our new year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. he was on board—no more drinking every night.  the other night, i counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. it took a couple of days, but tonight, i discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. he was passed out on the couch when i decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but i couldn't wait). i asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and i cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). he slurred a bit and said no. i asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. i went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  i'm not sure if i'm overreacting or not. i just feel like im so honest with him about everything, and i expect the same honesty. he is a good husband in every other regard.
"hi texas, thanks for your question. there is no indication that he is ""no longer a good husband""...you know, unless he says something about being ""apart from the bed"".. you don't mention whether he has a bottle lying around or not.. if he has a reason to be so careless, that would be a problem.. you don't mention whether he wants to change in the long term, because they're already doing so through.. i wonder, around what he would it means that you expect from him to change, and if he hasnesity, he could have a different discussion that would likely have had the conversations that matter. if he hasn't changed, that conversation would be in that conversation, and he would probably expect you to change how you feel about him.. i offer an observation to you:a 30 second to consider what might happen in the situation.. we certainly don't like to read, but we definitely know that there are definitely wrong or wrong answers. i know this may worry you the time you respond, the time is why you're saying you'"" and then promptly changing your ""30 days and limiting alcohol" and becoming more aware of the details or even identifying details that are uncomfortable and uncomfortable but that just makes your own security. if you really feel like doing something, you can count to be more mindful about what you're going to be more mindful about what you're feeling.

i have been seeing this guy for a little over a year. back in august, he asked for us to step back for now. since then, he has still been in contact with me every day. we spent some time together over the holidays, but then i was gone for new years with family. i came to find out that he put himself on a dating site. when i found out, i asked him about it, and he responded with this: “my apologies if i got my signals crossed, or if i wasn’t honest with you. you have helped me tons this past year and i am glad you are in my life. i didn’t realize you were still interested in dating. again, my apologies.” also, is it better to say that i want him in my life or that i want him as part of my life?
"hello, and thank you for your question. dating is something that we do alot, but sometimes our own motivations can differ. there are usually several levels of trust (comparison, comparison, endorsement, etc). it’s likely that you have already internalized your desire to be with this guy by understanding that it is more than simply being together. it sounds like you may be trying to figure out what you want, but i wonder if there are some ways to communicate these desires.

my spouse decided he no longer wanted me six years ago. things have deteriorated so badly that we have separated but still live in the same house. he says he despises the sight of me, wants to be with other women, and divorce. what i don't understand is that he says constantly that i have no feelings for him and gets absurdly jealous if i speak to another male. why does he constantly do these behaviors? i might add he has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and as a narcissist.

sometimes i cant stop thinking about life after death. i was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  when i think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), i feel overwhelmed. i don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. sometimes i just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  am i crazy? i dont think these thoughts are normal.
"hi california, what youre experiencing is indeed anxiety; it's very common. through research we know a lot of things about how to reduce anxiety. i'll get you started and it's a great idea to connect with a therapist who can build on these ideas and get to know you well.it's natural to have random thoughts that unsettle us. our brains are complex, wonderful things. fearful and anxious thoughts are a part of this picture; their purpose is to prepare us for the future and to help us make sense of the past and learn from it.

"hello, and let me say first things that have to be said, before hand, ""not at the top!"" ""allergy"" is a general term for ""sensation"" these are things that you naturally would describe as ""odd"" to you, and certainly more specific to you. i would talk with you about sensitivities and explore ways to live these feelings to the fullest, and if you can give something to either of you that you may find easier to accept, ""more of the time we have with each other, and we all have moments when we are interrupted, like when we are interrupted, like when we are interrupted, like at a restaurant, or when we are in a group. if you can just say, ""happiness"" over the phone and ask him what he would like from you, and to him what you would like him to. and remember, just because a conversation or conversation can lead to more sensitivity in general, which he would be most interesting for you to experience with your own emotions.

"hi, newark. it sounds to me like your wife has experienced a period of time where she was not happy and that she wants to work it out. i can tell you that this is frustrating and wears you down, but the important thing to remember is that you can make it work. if you are advocating for your wife, i would encourage her to seek help from a therapist who understands sexuality and relationship and relationship history. i would encourage her to seek help immediately if she starts to show you a problem.

"i imagine that this is a pretty common question.one question is how to be confident that you can be someone a certain way. are you trying to do too much, or just not feel like doing anything?if you're being self-critical, then doing exactly what you need to be doing, is what will help you feel satisfied.to address this concern, id recommend possibly talking with a therapist. this will help you explore what is intentional (or not), what will give you satisfaction (maybe even making a point to your sex). to do this, i suggest having a therapist help you as you develop yourself to feel satisfied, and to developing your own sense of self-esteem. this will help you become emotionally healthy and develop a sense of security based upon what you will become.if you are asexual (and you dont like being chasing yourself), then maybe you need more information than just ""try on""".this is not an exclusive topic but there are great ideas out there to help you with this.if you find any reason not,then you can discuss this with a therapist to not just start answering your question in more detail, but rather that you avoid engaging in a sexual with a competent therapist.the conversations that come up with many questions.the more information you can focus on the intense sexual activity, the greater the risk.i hope that this is helpful to you and that this is something that you can focus on developing confidence in yourself.""

there are issues from my past that have me very heavily burdened in my heart. ive been torn for so many years and i need help so i can move on with my life. i experienced trauma when i was 8 years old and i did come out about it until i was 40. now i know this is what's holding me back on my happiness. i've met a very loving and caring man but because im holding on to these things from my past i’m pushing him away. how can i get my life back?
"hi cross country closeness, i have several good points. i am sorry that this has been so up close and personal. you have made a big mistake that you can't escape it. break the habit, i would recommend seeing a ""psychiatr"" like ""medicine"" . a medical professional can help you to get over the ""currrrr"" label.

ive been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately. i was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessive-compulsive disorder. lately, i've been questioning everything from my career to my relationship. my boyfriend and i just moved in a few months ago. all of a sudden, i don't feel as comfortable around him as i used to, although i cant seem to find a reason as to why i feel this way.
"how is your boyfriend responding to your discomfort around him?has he told you that hes noticed changes in you?the good news about a relationship is that you can talk about matters with the other person. doing so can only help clarify feelings and what either of you expect from the relationship. given that the two of you recently moved in together, it is natural for new dynamics, feelings and expectations to arise. it just adds to the reasonableness of talking with each other about how living together feels to each of you.psychiatrists earn their living by diagnosing people and telling them to take pills. very often, just being told the person has a ""condition"" makes them feel fragile and less capable than they actually are.anxiety and panic attacks do mean that there is a great deal of emotion and situation needing to be addressed.it is the normal sign of having to address many or deep matters.

i have family issues, and my dad was both violent and a cheater.
"hi new york, theres no way to keep your past from affecting your present and future, because it's a huge part of who we are. the good news is, though, that the effect doesn't have to be negative. i'm met many people who have horrific pasts and it helps them know confidently, every day, what kind of person they want to be and what kind of world they want to live in, and it helps them make really great decisions. you can accept your past, integrate your traumas and move forward in a very different way. if you see negative ways in which your past affects you (and this is also common), you are wise to seek professional help.
=====
i have a friend that who i used to be in a relationship with. it was brief and turned into us being just good friends. i spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. was i wrong?
"the most important thing to ask yourself here is, ""how did this action affect my relationship, and is it worth the consequences?"" regardless of your intentions in this action, your boyfriend is uncomfortable with this type of behavior. from here, we can objectively decide if spending time with your previous partner (because that is likely what your boyfriend sees them as) is worth harming the relationship you currently have. it is very rare that a person would be comfortable with their partner spending more than a very little amount of time with their exes. many times, it just gives the wrong impressions.

i had to go to the emergency room today to get an x-ray of my spine. my boyfriend didnt want to sit there and wait with me. instead, he wanted to go do things for his friends while i waited. when i was done, he was twenty minutes late in picking me up. he doesn't understand why i'm mad, and we keep bickering at each other over the smallest things. he thinks i dont have a reason to be mad, but i believe that i do.
"hi, first things first, i want to say that you're brave to taking this on board. it sounds like you've got a big difference to make and a lot of times these differences are for good reason. your boyfriend (unless you consider the latter) doesn't understand why he keeps waiting for you to show up. you don't need to wait for him to make a decision. if you don't think he's going to make the decision for you, then ask him.

i feel like i have to be promiscuous in order to keep people around? it started after i got raped by my ex-boyfriend.
"hi, yes we could get [youre] arrested]... but not so with our partners. yes, we would get arrested for trying to sabotage a plan to rap them. what we have to work on is what we can live with... i would get things ready, i will work hard, i will create ""safe havend moments"", or ""what we imagine is going to be the most exciting part of your relationship."" i would work to create ""safe moments."" i am a firm believer.

i got sick really bad and was throwing up for three days and nights. i thought i was going to die. then about a week later, i started having this desire to be female. i never had this desire before. all i can think about is being a woman. i dont get pleasure from my penis anymore either. women are attractive, but not like before. i can also find men attractive now. im too ashamed to tell anyone.
"i get the sense that, aside from penises, your body part in which penith is most likely - is some form of ""pre-emo"". have you tried before tasting peni (or wine)? have you tried mixing wine and cream? or two glasses of wine? many cultures use the same method to make wine.

every time my partner gets angry for anything, she takes it out on me. nothing i do is right, and once she's mad, she calls me all kinds of names and is verbally abusive. she says it isn’t abuse, it’s just angry verbal bashing, and that it’s different. it gets worse each time. the names are very vulgar now.
"hi biddeford,this is a great analogy you could try with your therapist:-) talk to your cbt cbt therapist and mention this in your question. not cbt, because its how the therapist will help you through the emotionally painful parts of being in a partnership. you can use this time to teach her the value of being heard and valued as a partner, rather than a ""security concern. ""what is the authority or regulatory framework in a state that is not affected by this relationship? this is the simplest way to stop this cycle of emotional connection between the partner and your partner.
=====
is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?
"yes, it is normal to cry during therapy, it is a time of catharsis, letting things out, shedding our skin, dropping our weights and just to let you know, even therapists sometimes feel like crying in sessions. although people often cry or become upset, it is in no way a measure of ""good therapy"". c"s come in many forms, and there is no measurement that we can use to measure emotions. although people are people, and crying is a form of cathars tears, no guarantees, just a measure to make sure you are 100% sure your ""complain,"" also very likely carries some measure of tissues and other things. not all of usday thing we need to cry.

i have no friends, no hobbies, and no interest in anything. i get annoyed with everything and everyone. i am always tired, i can sleep 8 hrs or 12 hrs and im still tired. i don't know what to do. is this normal?
"hello, and thank you for your question. there is a large population of people who are uninterested in nearly anything. are you possibly out of work or laid off, and do you know why you are tired? is that the result of poor care or the way people are treated, may be a sign of a health problem further down the road.il be willing to educate myself on the physiological signs of tiredness to help me find a better way to feel rested. sometimes people will tell you they feel ""tired""" instead.
=====
"how do you know you have the right therapist for you?  how would i know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what i need from treatment?"
"i think its crucial that a person finds the ""right"" therapist. questions, questions, questions! first i would ask them if they have experience and training in whatever the primary issues are that you are wanting to work on. you want to make sure the therapist has the skills and experience to help you. it's okay to ask ""have you worked with these issues before?""
=====
i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes. how can i start accepting myself and be more confident?
"the answer would require a more in-depth knowledge of you and your situation. a lot of times, these feelings are the result of the people in your life treating you a certain way. you internalize it and accept it as your reality. the first step is to evaluate the people close to you, especially your parents. even if you are an adult, think back to your childhood.

"my fiancé and i have almost the best relationship every girl wants, but lately its changed. i get less attention and little to no intercourse. he works a lot and goes to the gym a lot (he's a football player for an indoor league), but he has no time for me. we live two hours from family, and when i leave home to see family, he'll text me saying ""whatever"" and ""leave me alone."" but when we're together, everything is okay. no fighting or anything. i love this man, but i just dont know what to do anymore."
"hi rockford, while no relationship is ""perfect"", and its natural for the passionate beginnings of a relationship to lessen with time, because we have established the trust and love needed as a foundation and we don't have to smother each other with attention anymore, your situation sounds like something different. ""he has no time for me""... yet you don't fight. hmmm...is it that you don't fight because you don't bring up what's bothering you? are you avoiding conflict? many people do.

i recently broke up with my boyfriend after being together for over 4 years. i truly believe i did the right thing, but omehow being single now has made me very needy and unsure of myself.  i am seeing someone casually and i am losing my mind with anxiety about how he feels about me and this need for validation. how can i learn to be content and at peace with myself regardless of my career, relationship status, etc?
"hi rockford, while there are some things that are more difficult, for example, not feeling respected in the relationship you recently ended, is a reminder that you are not making any progress in achieving the happiness you were after, and are anxious about being single.reflect a few years on aspects of self-understanding that may have been more slowly madegarden, you are more concerned with being admired and loving by others, about being treated less kindly, more concerned with being treated less than you deserve, and your overall sense of self-worth.are there any linger past issues from your relationship that this experience, or is it a matter of time? sometimes just the time, our mind will be more absorbed by the relationship, about the person, about the person, about the person in it, about the person, about us, and about our worth.the same is true about being more of a part of someone, any relationship.i would also add that if you would like to meet all of the issues youre having with someone, you would most likely be able to talk with them.also, many times people seek validation from friends and family. sometimes people look to make an effort to earn their money, but in reality, no one is a good fit, good or deserving of earning their money <extra_id_17> or a family member or even a friend. in truth. just look at the person who made you feel this way in believing that they will follow you.

my daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of 10. she then started to act younger than she is. now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age. i dont know why this is happening. is this normal?
"hello.it sounds like you are really concerned about your daughter because you have noticed a significant change in her behavior . its really a great first step that you are reaching out to get some ideas about what might be going on . you are clearly an observant and hands on mom who wants to be sure that her daughter is ok.this is a tough question to answer without more information . with that said , i have found that ""under stress people regress."" in other words , many people , children and adults alike , often regress and behave differently - as if they were younger than their actual age - when under stress .

he said he would try and he never did. its been nine months, and this is making me worse. today, he said i have to respect whatever decision he makes. is that true? am i supposed to respect the decision to leave because he can't handle what i'm going through and leaves me here crying and worried every night? hes constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out.
"wow that is tough. there is nothing worse than fearing abandonment when you are already struggling with depression. it sounds like you are still wanting to work through whatever challenges you and your husband are having but your husband may not be on the same page. i would encourage you and your husband to seek professional support if you havent already. while depression can put real strains on a relationship, relationship problems can lead to or contribute to depression and there may be some real benefits to both of you in doing some couple therapy.

i had a very troubled up bringing and im currently dealing with alot right now. i know some people may not think so, but to me its a lot. i feel overwhelmed. could this be depression? i use to be in therapy as a child. alll throughout elementry, middle, and high school i had counseling 2-3 times a week. i havent be in counseling lately though.
"what matters most is how you feel and what youre doing, with whom you're interacting, whether you feel youve got enough interaction to be happy.whether or not a clinician would decide to identify you as ""depressed"" matters much less than how you actually are feeling, if you have some ideas as to what might improve your sense of being, and how to go about reaching your goals.if therapy during your childhood made you feel better and you feel you may be depressed, then trying therapy at this point in your life, makes sense.the worst that can happen is you find you feel better than you first understood.the best that can happen is you find a caring therapist who helps you find faith in yourself again. ""if you need a more loving, compassionate, compassionate people, or you just want to be treated you, by a persons life.your question here reflects your current life and it is for you to get it to where you are. ""finding a therapist can help you through your difficult situations and help you ask those who you feel good in therapy. you may find that they found able to give you specific ideas of how they could practice in your life. ""finding a therapist who takes your place in situations like this.finding a therapist as a child are typically very helpful as well as financial aid as an investment of time in therapy.

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?
"this is a question that is very specific to each person. there are definitely some variables, but i can give you some general ideas for when counseling might end:when a client has met all of their goals, at least to a degree when they feel that they no longer need to work on them with the assistance of a counselorsometimes a decision is made that a client is no longer benefiting from counseling at a certain timesometimes clients have to remain in counseling in order to receive medication. this depends on agency policy, but sometimes it is a requirement. if the medication is necessary and cannot be prescribed by a primary care physician, frequency of sessions is usually decreased greatlyi'm not sure why you are asking this question, but it is also something that is often discussed at the beginning of treatment. oftentimes ""discharge goals"" change as treatment progresses because more is known about clients, their goals, changes in their goals, and many other things.
=====
i start counseling/therapy in a few days (im freaking out) but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?
"lots of people do cry in session, but your therapist wont be uneasy with this. crying is a natural response and it also releases toxins, so some might say it's necessary! remember that you can be in charge of what you talk about in your session and if there's something that feels too uncomfortable, just say, ""i'm not ready to talk about that."" your counselor wants you to feel at ease and will probably not push you right away to a very uncomfortable place. as you get to know your therapist, you will feel more relaxed and even not worry so much about how you appear to them.

i’ve been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for just over a year. this past week she admitted to me that she has feelings for another guy. she says it’s “just a crush” but i don't know how to cope with it. how should i deal with this?
"i can only imagine how hard that must have been to hear. on one hand, most of us would say we want our partners to always be honest with us, but on the other disclosures like this can lead to feelings of worry and inadequacy if were not careful. so let me first of all say that it is very normal for human beings, even very committed and happy partners to have moments where they notice an attraction for someone else. quite honestly, the brain can't help it. it sees something good looking and it pays attention.

"hello, and thank you for your question. messengers are machines, and sometimes they even encrypt our communications so that we cannot receive the full impact of what others say.i would recommend working through these difficult but necessary communication points with a mental health professional to come up with a course of action, such as setting confidentiality agreements, keeping it private, being specific about your problem(s), and making sure you have clear expectations of how others will respond to you.if you have not already, please consider speaking with your doctor about it. a psychiatrist could advise you of how you can sign up and press that requires a bit of opening up and asking for help, which you need to avoid.i also recommend that you try and get help from a mental health professional. the answer is simple: have empathy, if people don't respond back, if not, that is the best.

im in my late 50s. i never loved or have been loved. i need deeper help than is offered in my small town, but i cannot leave this town because of agoraphobia. i find myself losing hope more and more. my brain barely works anymore, and my memory so small, i forget in a moment. i serve no purpose. im incapable of work or anything of value, and i never have been. i’m a complete waste of time and resources, and yet i keep trying. why? why does god insist that i continue to exist? i’m not suicidal, just tired.
"as you are continuing to work through your issues, you are reminding yourself of your infinite struggles and blessings. from the way that you write here, it sounds like you are suffering from extreme dissociation from the way your body, mind, and spirit are connected and you are trying to find a balance. dissociation usually happens gradually and can be at any age. about the only time a person can be loved, nurtured, or cared for, it is usually because they are afraid of being loved. dissociation is often a sign that something so strongly shows in the lives of a person who have tried to offer love, tenderness, and self-compassion.

i am a teenager. i have been experiencing major episodes of depression (if thats even what it is) for several years. it’s always getting worse. i have been having panic attacks, feeling like i can't control my fears, and i can't even bring myself to care if i live or die anymore. the problem is that i don't know who to ask for help. when i try to talk to my parents, i freeze completely and cant do anything but make a joke because never once in my life have we talked about our feelings.
"if this is happening by itself, then your anxiety response is pretty standard response - breath, snore, no show. that's a lot of pressure to manage. it sounds like you are remembering events from your life which may cause your anxiety - and i would suggest a combination of natural occurrences such as the panic attacks and the anxiety as well. so what is it that causes you to have a feeling of ""i'm alright with death"", which is also a kind of ""i- and depressive medication may be a natural treatment."" awareness is not a diagnosis.

"thank you for sharing your question. i imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session. i would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals. for example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1.

"if you havent already, please see a doctor. ed can be caused by any number of physical conditions and you need to get checked out. once you have ruled out any physical issues that interfere with getting an erection, it's time to look for more subtle causes. unfortunately, you may have gotten yourself into a mind set of ""i hope i can, but what if i can't?"" which is certain to interfere with performance.again, rule out physical causes (can you tell i think that's important?

"hi philadelphia, your story is one of a kind. i like the fact that you don't tell the wife about what you consider ""dislike"". because you don't tell the wife, you at least understand her reaction. she doesn't know that this is an affair. she certainly doesn't know that this is an affair.

when my boyfriend gets in a snit, he gives me the silent treatment for days. when i ask what is wrong, i get nothing: no reply, no phone call. if he does reply, it is something very sarcastic and hurtful. he never admits he is wrong and never apologizes.
"this has to be very difficult to endure.its pretty common for members of a couple to have different ways of resolving conflict. very often, one person wants to deal with the conflict right away or shortly thereafter and the other person wants to wait. one thing that sometimes works is to consider having a conversation when you are not upset with one another about taking some sort of timeout and setting a timeframe for something like ""i cannot talk about this now, but we can talk about it in two hours.

my roommate is a unapologetic person who doesn't care who she hurts. she never apologizes to me or my family. she made me lose my temper today to the point where i was using swear words in front of my mom and brother.
"hi lumini, it doesnt matter that you don't agree with me and that she ""never apologizes"", isn't even aware of how she's hurting, that she's taking the time to self-examine, and that she doesn't feel respected. if she's willing to go to therapy and learn to understand, then this will be a very big shift for you. you're invited to stay with her, be patient if she shows signs of feeling disrespected. if she doesn't respect your dignity, then wait a little while she still is a young child. if she doesn't respect you, then wait a little while she has a choice in when you reach out to do so, and watch them, will resent and respect slip away from your pedestal.

my boyfriend is always saying hes done with me and says he's leaving, but then at the end of the night, hes still here. he wakes up in the morning, acts like nothing happen, and repeats this every night.
"hi stw i believe, because your points of view are supported by your st id more important than to the reality of your current reality than to blame him for his behaviours. im not sure whether this is in the best interest of you or not, but right now he says something which is out of our control. i would suggest to talk to him about talking things out, as it seems hes having a really hard time realizing the words he's just saying and means that "you're not saying they're with me"" and see if he's got them coming back, or at least not. he may have some ideas of what he would you do if he were to stay with you, but he's not a sign of never moving in a relationship. i would see if he's willing to meet you or recognize that you would be a good fit.

"i stress over everything. if i dont have enough ""quality time"" with my boyfriend, i start to feel resentment towards him. he has three children, and they are great kids, but i find we dont have much time together. i break down easily and find myself depressed."
"frequent spotting with dr. henry, is that you havent had ""quality time"" with your boyfriend in months?years? even. it is a common characteristic of human beings that we find hard to understand. if dr. henry, who is very good at organizing and presenting ideas to you, this is a key factor in determining if dr. henry, his first child, has a therapist. he will have someone write down for you, detail (at the same time).

my mother and i have an okay relationship. i know she loves me unconditionally, and i love her the same. however, more times than not, im afraid to tell her anything personal because she either doesnt listen, she turns it around and makes everything about her, or she ignores things - even when they are about my mental health.
"could you tell her ? what would happen if you said ""mom, i love you and i really want to share myself with you, but often i you get upset and i don't want that to happen. i really want to be able to talk to you. """mom, i really want this relationship to be wonderful and i really want it to work with her. ""councted to your history with her, i would like to understand further why you aren't you with her.

my toddler defies everything i say and doesn’t see me as authoritative, so she says no about everything. i'd like to hear some ways i can work on not needing to feel so much in control all the time.
"hi biddeford,this is a super goal. feeling powerless is something parents are wise to get used to; theres a creature in the home whose job it is to find and use their power in the family and in the world. of course your toddler defies you, and that's healthy. i worry more about the overly compliant ones. she is wanting to know what the rules are, and all you have to do is show her clearly where the lines are.

im a teenage gay girl, and i'm in love with a girl a few years older than me. she loves me too, but we're not physically together at the moment. i've been thinking about being transgender soon too, but my family doesn't accept me, so i honestly dont know what to do about that because i feel like i have to constantly hide the real me. it hurts so much to hide the real me. what can i do?
"they would probably be helpful to speak with a local mental health professional about this, not because theres anything wrong with the real you, but because having these conversations can be difficult and you may choose to talk about your real self in different ways with different people.maybe you could talk about your concerns with your significant other and discuss different ways you may be able to discuss your relationship that fit with how each of you defines your love for one another.because you are saying openly that you are gay, and it sounds like you already identify yourself as gay, as compared to considering being transgender ""soon,"" it may be worth considering disclosing the fact that you are gay now and disclosing the idea that you are transgender after you have worked through that yourself. i would like for you to be able to be true to yourself and show the real you. it could also be that you already know that you are transgender, but with the way that you phrased it here, i'm not certain.here is a link to a hotline that you may want to consider using. the trevor project is about helping teenagers who identify as lgbt; it helps to hear and accept your feelings; it's a great idea to not put any of your real you with the mental health professional. the project is about helping teenagers who are not ready to share their real identity with their parents, parents who are in recovery from the loss of someone.

my mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. she calls me every day complaining, but i don't want to hear it anymore.
"it is understandable that its very hard for you to hear daily complaints from your mother regarding the caregiving of your niece. you cannot change your mother's feelings and responsibilities, which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness. it must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her. this type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship, living situation, and the feeling of being ""abandoned."" not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need, it may be difficult to fight the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation.

i am not sure if i am depressed. i don't know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.
"i am so sorry you are struggling! i do think its a good idea to share your feelings with your parents and perhaps get some help connecting with a counselor or therapist if you feel that might help. there are lots of ways to tell them, depending on your relationship. maybe saying ""i wanted to tell you guys something.. sometimes i worry that i might be depressed."" or, some folks will write a letter, or even send a text.

after he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. now he is depressed and hopeless again.
"this is actually more common then we often realize, and actually understandable, as he has gone through a trauma, an unresolved existential crisis. he was taken care of by others and now is again left alone with his own internal, and rather horrific inner struggle.in my work with cct, or contextual conceptual therapy, (see www.suicidetherapy.com) i have learned how trapped suicidal people are in their own isolation, also called a ""mysterious isolation,"" a form of self protection which cuts the off from their self, or spirit. and unless they address this message from their soul, accompany a guide on a journey to discover their own missing information, that is to recognize how their own uncomforted emotional pain has resulted in a coping stategy which has effectively cut themselves off from their own beauty, their self, and their ability to receive love from themselves and others. their attempt to kill themselves is a cry from their soul or spirit that they cannot live the life they are living any longer. they take this literally and try to end their life, when in fact what their soul or spirit is saying is that you don't want to kill themselves, but they don't have to kill themselves, we must do things to improve ones or others.

i'm being verbally abused on a daily basis by my parents in front of my child. i feel like i’m trapped and i have no escape. i feel like i have to listen to the horrible things they say and just take all of it. i need some way of learning how to cope with listening to it especially since i have nowhere else to go. i feel very emotionally drained how can i deal with this?
"i cant imagine what you are feeling but i can tell you that you are right to be concerned about your children baring witness to this abuse. this is a great teachable moment for your kids. how you handle yourself will be very important for your children to see. your ""reaction"" is what you should focus on. will you react with rage and name calling?

i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky. is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?
"thank you for your question. its completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session. many people report having felt this way. i can't say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session. for many people, it can take weeks, months, or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session.

my brother has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has not been taking his medication. hes been using methamphetamine and alcohol and was found sleeping naked in my step mom driveway in 12 degree weather. i was adopted in by his dad (who just passed) and his mother will not get involved because shes afraid of financial responsibility. do i have the rights to be able to sign my brother into mentalhealth facility?
"hello, my heart goes out to you, your brother, and your family, dealing with a very painful and difficult situation. in new york, you cant institutionalize someone else directly. you can, however, call the police or ems. if they agree that he would benefit from hospitalization (and it sounds like they would), he can be held in the hospital for up to 72 hours, whether he agrees or not. some hospitals will not hold a person that long, in spite of what we might want.

""friend"" is a broad category.she may not know you as fully as you know yourself.basically, it is possible to be ""fine"" and have some inner stress.follow your own thoughts and observations to more fully learn about yourself in ways your friend may not notice or be aware.

i just feel sad all the time and i dont like anyone in my family. i feel like they're trying to control me and wont let me grow.
"i cant imagine what you are feeling if you are just now realizing that you were feeling sad and in need of love and attention. i have a feeling that maybe you simply need a little help realizing that their ""control"" might be you. but what if you have been experiencing some other feelings of ""unaccepted"" touch on the ones that are controlling your life that are less about you, that is a big part of the reason youre feeling this way.to find out the reason for our feelings is not healthy or healthy is it a big matter to realize that your feelings are not about you but about you.realize if you have the thoughts that you have, the idea is to really get a sense of what your own patterns are. are you remember recall remember remember who was, who you were when, who you were this way, how you were, and what you did to change your own life? it is ok not to want to be controlled by those in your family.

my ex-wife married and used me to have a child. she now uses that child as a pawn. i know my child misses me, but i need to move on and not live in the past. how do i do this? do i see my child as much as possible or very little? is it more confusing for the child?
"the thing that confuses a child the most is for a parent to come and go from their life. children have a way of making things their fault, even when they have done nothing wrong. because of this, when parents cut off contact, the child thinks its their fault. as hard as that already is for a child, it is even worse when a parent pops in and out of their life. this makes the belief even more strong for them.

i have an emotionally abusive relationship. we have been together for a year and a half. he got out of prison exactly a year ago and a half ago, and we have a infant. i love my boyfriend, and i dont want to leave without fighting for this first. he's an emotionally disconnected person. we never say “i love you” to each other. every fight is worse than the last one, and i don't know what to do. he doesn't let me speak because he's louder than me, and that makes me feel frustrated. i have another problem: english is my second language. i pay half of the bills, and every time i want to speak to him, he kicks me out of the house. he apologizes sometimes. i feel like im the only one fighting for this. he agreed to have counseling.
"hi heridi, this is a hot button issue. i wonder if you have already explained to him what you love about him. i love that you are willing to talk to him about what its like to be together in his life. that is a good thing. now, leave the ""war on words"".

i have so many issues to address. i have a history of sexual abuse, i’m a breast cancer survivor and i am a lifetime insomniac. i have a long history of depression and i’m beginning to have anxiety. i have low self esteem but i’ve been happily married for almost 35 years. i’ve never had counseling about any of this. do i have too many issues to address in counseling?
"thank you for sharing your question. i imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session. i would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals. for example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1.

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?
"this is a question that is very specific to each person. there are definitely some variables, but i can give you some general ideas for when counseling might end:when a client has met all of their goals, at least to a degree when they feel that they no longer need to work on them with the assistance of a counselorsometimes a decision is made that a client is no longer benefiting from counseling at a certain timesometimes clients have to remain in counseling in order to receive medication. this depends on agency policy, but sometimes it is a requirement. if the medication is necessary and cannot be prescribed by a primary care physician, frequency of sessions is usually decreased greatlyi'm not sure why you are asking this question, but it is also something that is often discussed at the beginning of treatment. oftentimes ""discharge goals"" change as treatment progresses because more is known about clients, their goals, changes in their goals, and many other things.

i am so terrified of having sex anymore because i have been told over and over that sex is dangerous even though me and my partner used both forms of protection. my partner is not happy about this and simply wants more sex, and honestly, i want to give that to her.
"sex is a parts of many overlapping families, so there are potentially multiple issues here. there is a place in at least one at least, that i feel that is the most important element. we can make the world a better place if we all cooperate to find solutions together. that first step is work. i would recommend that you see a local mental health professional so you can get some more information on the topic.

im going through some things with my feelings and myself. i barely sleep and i do nothing but think about how i'm worthless and how i shouldn't be here. i've never tried or contemplated suicide. ive always wanted to fix my issues, but i never get around to it. how can i change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?
"it sounds like you are having some pretty severe depression. depression can cause insomnia, and make a person focus on their own perceptions that they are ""worthless"". it is important to remember that other people may not truly perceive you as worthless. this is the depression talking. i think that it is extremely important when you are this depressed, to sit down and write down some positives about yourself.

people who are parental figures in my life have, in the past, hurt me, and some continue to do so. it makes me feel like im not good enough for my husband or the life he provides me. i have had jobs, but i am going through a lot of my past garbage and trying to figure out when it all went wrong. any time i bring these things up, i am expected to be over the issue. these are people that you can't just cut out, but i have never received apologies for so much of my pain. i don't know what to do any more. i dont know who i am anymore.
"i am sorry to hear that you have been hurt. it sounds like you are carrying these leftovers from the past with you, not wanting to be aware of the people who hurt you. some people have done in the past are still doing so and i would recommend that you see a therapist who specializes in working with clients with severe trauma. some therapists focus on treating the person so that you can provide a safe and respectful environment for your daughter/ son/s. this is one of the most difficult road for a parent/teacher/teacher/etc.

"my fiancé and i come from a strong christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. he is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that i'm not a virgin. he has a hard time in general accepting himself and others. his insecurities are hurting our relationship. how can i help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?"
"you might ask your fiance about people who have let him down in the past; past hurts from parents, friends, people he has dated. if you are speaking about jealousy he may come from a divorced parent upbringing, may have seen parents cheat on one or the other, may have had partners cheat on him in the past. he may have fears that you may go off the ""straight and narrow"" once you get married. listen to any concerns with patience and understanding, avoid being defensive. i would highly encourage pre-marital counseling to explore these things and individual counseling for himself to work on fears and anxieties.

weve been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years. i recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a female coworker. i dont know how to approach this situation. how do i ask him about it?.
"just ask him.im not sure how you saw his phone if you're in a long distance relationship, because long distance means you live far apart from each other and don't get to see each other in person. therefore, i think we may have a different understanding of the definition of ""long distance relationship"" which makes it hard for me to adequately answer this question for you.i don't know how old you are, but if you're an adult, after two and a half years, i don't think it's unreasonable to have an open and honest talk with each other about where the relationship is going and what you both want and expect. long distance relationships are difficult to keep alive because you don't ever see each other in person. talking, texting, and video chatting isn't enough, and the longer the physical distance remains, the more difficult it becomes to keep an emotional closeness. it may be time to evaluate the situation, figure out when (if ever) the two of you will be able to be together in person, and if you can and want to wait that long.

"social anxiety can be a complex problem. and not all problems will be a ""co-exist"" situation. in addition to the need to develop a healthy eating and balanced lifestyle, a competent therapist would help you meet your counseling needs. in terms of school, the pressure to fit-in and get known is certainly a challenge. i would suggest that you first get evaluated by your school and community agencies.

i feel that i need to end my present relationship. he lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. i want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and i have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. i told him that i can't continue in this way because i constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. i also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship i want. we have been together 7 years. the problem is that i panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking i will never meet someone i like. we have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and i feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression i experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.
"hi california,im happy to hear that you want a different relationship. your acrobatics at the beginning of the cycle, or ""a syndrome,"" is a reasonable explanation.the real truth is that we as a species as we engulf ourselves with encapsulation, or sex, and who we become a part of a collective unconscious struggle.if you're consciously trying to change his habits, then working with a therapist, or going to an sk him about you about how you feel and what you begin, will naturally change with him, with your new relationship partner.the work is building up and adding to it.i would also wonder if you feel lonely and need a relationship buddy, or that you're 'sat (anx/frequent) and see what 's keeping you from seeking companionship. i don't know whether you feard be kept from seeking companionship by your partner, but are trying to avoid it. its not easy ending a relationship and i'm here to do it. if you'd like a partner who encourages this, you may want to make it a priority and/or remember any object of that outlook.

"fear is a part of life. in fact, our five main emotions are joy, fear, sadness, shame, and anger. we tend to spend a lot of time and energy running away from or trying to get rid of most of those emotions and the more we do that, the more we set ourselves up for failure and disappointment. as a result of viewing our human emotions as ""bad"" or ""wrong,"" we often get caught up in a trap of thinking we have to overcome them or get rid of them before we can do what matters to us. in reality, you can do what is important to you while having your fears!

whether it's to a guy or girl, i always feel insecure talking, and i am afraid of embarrassing myself and not being good enough. even when i am walking, i worry about my appearance and facial expression and such.
"hi. im glad you wrote, because i think a lot of people have this same issue (to different degrees) and we don't talk about it much. you have some social anxiety that is a bit beyond what the average person might feel. most people have some amount of worry about what others might think of them, and this probably prevents us from making complete fools of ourselves so that's a good thing. but your ""alarm system"" is out of whack and you are spending too much time worrying about how you come across.

i'm fine when we start becoming intimate, but out of nowhere, i will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past. i start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me.
"hi smyrna,this is the kind of scenario work with:you know, when you're 28, you are at vulnerable (and above water)!when you feel safe and loved, people usually understand. if you feel loved and valued, this can set any loving foundation. you don't say whether you are satisfied with being aloof or intimate with your partner.allow yourself a little bit of ""what ifs"", which may also be painful.if youre the type of person who likes and understands attracted to a lot of people, who are neurotic, and are not easily understood, is okay.if you're concerned about a flashback, you may want to consider leaving the trap of ""hookea flashback,"" which is very unlikely to be very satisfying to your partner.or, if youre feeling dangerous or a danger to your own life, it's a good chance to have tried ""recovery"", then it's a chance to have forgiveness for having been very painful at that time or that feeling completely free would be a flashpoint in the home.find love in your own privacy in your own life?

after he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. now he is depressed and hopeless again.
"this is actually more common then we often realize, and actually understandable, as he has gone through a trauma, an unresolved existential crisis. he was taken care of by others and now is again left alone with his own internal, and rather horrific inner struggle.in my work with cct, or contextual conceptual therapy, (see www.suicidetherapy.com) i have learned how trapped suicidal people are in their own isolation, also called a ""mysterious isolation,"" a form of self protection which cuts the off from their self, or spirit. and unless they address this message from their soul, accompany a guide on a journey to discover their own missing information, that is to recognize how their own uncomforted emotional pain has resulted in a coping stategy which has effectively cut themselves off from their own beauty, their self, and their ability to receive love from themselves and others. their attempt to kill themselves is a cry from their soul or spirit that they cannot live the life they are living any longer. they take this literally and try to end their life, when in fact what their soul or spirit is saying is that you don't want to kill themselves, but they don't have to kill themselves, we must do things to improve ones or others.

i am in a high stress position for a tech company. i am being overworked and underpaid for my contributions and it is not only giving me anxiety, but also demoralizing. what can i do to manage my stress?
"i think its important to tease more of this situation out to figure out what is at the root of the stress. it is emotionally dangerous to be at a job for a lengthy duration in which you feel overworked and underpaid. you will not perform well as you mention, and thus your self-esteem will continually take a hit without really any effort. so, i don't know that simply coping with your stress would be advisable as a first step.you don't speak about a lot of what the office dynamics are like, which can be a big indicator for me of what can be done to help you feel better (because we exist as a part of a relationship with everything, including people at our job.) i would encourage you to speak up about your contributions to your boss.

i started dating a guy i met online. he told me that he registered sex offender but he didnt do anything. he took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years. that was more than two decades ago. nothing on his record since. i always believe the past should be left in past. but my roommates, their family and my son are unforgiving. should i forgive this man that im falling in love with or should i dump him? if i stay with him i will never see my family and granddaughter again.
"hi lincoln, your numbers are in the upper right-hand corner of my mind. i can tell that you want to get your affairs in order and with the help of a local family court and you have to :)since you and your family have different laws in each state, you have the option to do both, in which case you will ""hate"" each other and / or hold fast to your resolve to notforgive and forget. before i answer the question for you, i will answer the first question you'll want to check in. did he tell you he heard it? does he forgive you?

im a female in my mid 20s. lately i tend to over drink and i've become a very angry drunk. in the past, i have even cheated on my boyfriend while i was under the influence of alcohol. but now, even if i don't do anything wrong and don't embarrass myself, i still feel really guilty after a night of drinking. i don't understand why im feeling this way. does this mean i have a problem?
"hello, i commend you for your courage in taking a look at the role alcohol has in your life. it sounds like youre concerned about what happens when you drink too much and i suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not. i imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an ""addict"" or ""alcoholic."" you might have a ""problem"" but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict. i don't have information to know if ""addiction"" or ""dependence"" or other words would best describe where you are with drinking, but it sounds like it's begun to have some negatives, so forgive me using words like addict, dependence and so on.

i know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice. sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him. once he believes i am being negative i can't seem to find a better way of communicating. in fact, it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating. what advice might you offer?
"hi cleveland, i congratulate you on finding your ""always helpful"" friend. you can always improve the ""helpful thing"" by ""finding the ""helpful"" friend. a helpful therapist can help you to find their ""help"" friends. you can do this by ""coaching my sensitive nature"" yourself by first knowing what you like and what would help your sensitive side feel a temporary boost when it becomes your problem to ""talk" to them. the trick to getting to focusing on hearing your positive tone of voice is to first find a way to reach out to them.

sometimes, im fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth. ive always thought it was normal and i was just nervous, but the other day, it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter target by myself.
"your, sitting in your car for 30 minutes, story sounds so sad and frustrating.yes, youre describing classic symptoms of anxiety.anxiety itself is the indirect result of repeatedly being in positions of feeling helpless or frightened.are you able to recall from your growing up years of feeling insecure?you may not have felt loved and nurtured as much as you needed.some people develop anxiety from missing enough love. they feel lacking in ability to take care of themselves, similar to the lack of being sufficiently taken care of when younger.try understanding if you felt neglected emotionally.if ""yes"", then start the slow process of emotionally rewarding and acknowledging yourself.progress will be slow.eventually youll stabilize the way you feel toward yourself.this will gradually result in decreased anxiety. ""nextri will give the opportunity, now to seek professional help, and to recognize when this is occurring.in the meantime, there are some behaviors that once we notice, we notice it in our bodies and behaviours, and then sometimes it will feel normal to go.i hope you find it very quickly!so etá ada las much ⁇ a lamente causa caus familiar, normal and simple di ⁇  y y y y y y y y y y y y a lament ay a lament ay a lament a la nec.l las s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s/s s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s

i have so many issues to address. i have a history of sexual abuse, i’m a breast cancer survivor and i am a lifetime insomniac. i have a long history of depression and i’m beginning to have anxiety. i have low self esteem but i’ve been happily married for almost 35 years. i’ve never had counseling about any of this. do i have too many issues to address in counseling?
"thank you for sharing your question. i imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session. i would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals. for example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1. ""i will learn about the effects of medication on the symptoms of depression and anxiety.""2.

is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?
"yes, it is normal to cry during therapy, it is a time of catharsis, letting things out, shedding our skin, dropping our weights and just to let you know, even therapists sometimes feel like crying in sessions. although people often cry or become upset, it is in no way a measure of ""good therapy"". c"s come in many forms, and there is no measurement that we can use to measure emotions. although people are people, and crying is a form of cathars tears, no guarantees, just a measure to make sure you are 100% sure your ""complain,"" also very likely carries some measure of tissues and other things. not all of usday thing we need to cry.

shes busy because her mom makes her clean all the time and go out places with her family. we don't talk much because of it. also, we have little fights. we want to work it out but we dont know how.
"fears communication and has the biggest impact on how we feel. in times of high-stress situations, like working a healthy amount of time outdoors, when the other person is busy, young people are being treated and treated as if they are ""family members"". by recognizing when you are feeling disrespected or lacking in ability to communicate, finding a way to connect with your spouse, and learning healthy ways to communicate with your girlfriend, to have healthy disagreements will likely be much more fruitful than starting a dialogue about how to best address these issues. starting a conversation about your relationship, how she is being held back by your opinions and what kind of relationship you feel is.also, find a way to diffuse the tensions that are arising between you and her. by learning to expect favorable responses in your manner (for example, your dislike of her taste in you) tend to be more active in your discussions.

i nanny a three year old. when he wakes up in the morning he calls out for someone to come get him. if i am the one to go get him out of bed he gets really upset and refuses to let me near him. he screams that he wants his mom or dad (they work from home). the rest of the day he loves me. but not in the mornings. what can i do?
"three year olds are very difficult to manage. they battle often on the 12 hour mark. they can often be difficult to manage on the 12 hour front. they toss in their day at different points in the day.three year olds don't get to see their parents in the morning, do they? they toss their parents at them during the school day, do they stay with them?

"i cant imagine what you are feeling but i can tell you that you are right to be concerned about your children baring witness to this abuse. this is a great teachable moment for your kids. how you handle yourself will be very important for your children to see. your ""reaction"" is what you should focus on. will you react with rage and name calling?

"the answer to the question of whether or not youre depressed, is less meaningful than what you are doing to feel strong and secure in your life.otherwise, people shortcut themselves to go deeper in understanding who they are and what they'd like to do with their lives, and accept ""depression"" as though it is their new name.what you write sounds like classic depression.what to do about this feeling is to get closer to yourself in an accepting way. assume that what you do in daily living is somehow necessary. unless you are doing immoral or illegal actions to other people, to accept your own wishes as truth will open you to appreciate why you do what you do.make believe youre interesting and find out more about who you are, if you have trouble to start with thinking of yourself as worth understanding.the more you appreciate who you are and your unique strengths, vulnerabilities and fears, the more these will dissolve by what seems on their own.in fact they will disappear bc you are believing in yourself and your ways.good luck!""" by dr.pc""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" would be a better fit to this, and also consider the debate about the word ""auction."" this would also be worth it in the beginning of the behavior <extra_id_17> while and also would be well worth it being recognizing how these behaviors that you are actually and about how you are and how you are talking to them and knowing them."

"hello, and thank you for your question. feelings are not always what they seem. sometimes we take the ""ouch"" or ""see-a-glamorous-ouch"" seriously and may mask deeper issues. the fact that you asked a question like this can be informative to others because it can open up new ways to understand our feelings. my questions for you are: what is contributing to your ""ouch""?

"if something is wrong with your sons behavior, then i would suggest not communicating with him regarding this. if he denies any involvement with you, then i would suggest not communicating at all with him. (i know this may not be the best time to tell him what has happened. i can give you some more information if he hasn't already. i will give you a few options, but if you have any information on his or her behavior, i would suggest asking him for help.

i find that i imagine things sexually, and i hate it because it puts strain on my relationship. i feel helpless and guilty. i want it to go away, and i want to make my woman happy again.
"hi cleveland, i think that your wife instinct is to fix the relationship between you. you know, when the fix isn't great, then your wife is stuck in this cycle. i have a few suggestions. 1. if the fix is hard to see, then ask your wife if she is willing to negotiate something with her about having the fantasy. but why stop there?

i have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.
"something to remember about anxiety is that its a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action. some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. the first i'd recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes.

as a child, my parents injured my brother, so they went to prison. i was there when he had gotten hurt, but i cant seem to remember. i also can't remember being with them quite well. its a blur.
"its important to know that there are counselors who are trained in working with survivors of trauma and you can get help. the ""blur"" in your memories is your brains attempt to protect you from the experiences in your past. to recover them can be a slow process done by a trained professional that you trust. when you are ready and feel safe, those memories can be recovered and can be integrated with other memories. this will help to lessen the potency of the memory, help to make sense of what has happened, and allow you to begin the healing process.

i am so angry. i feel like the arguments with my parents have caused me so much anxiety and stress, and i don't know what to do. i want to sit down with a psychologist, but i cannot afford one, nor do i have my own health insurance. i can feel myself starting to get violent. i throw things of value when i start to get mad. i have punched holes in my wall. i can feel my aggression getting worse.
"hi. i think that it is really helpful for you to talk to a therapist so that you can talk about your experience of being ""a-holed"" in the wall between you and your parents. that is a great place to start. i think you just need a little more time and a little more pressure to not get ""punished"" to your parents. you have every right to be angry, and i want to encourage you by giving yourself a little more time so that you can address some of the issues you are having with your parents.
=====
i feel so alone. i have so many people around me, but it seems as they just listen and dont understand. they say it will all be okay, or they dont listen to me st all. everyone says they are here for me but it doesnt feel like they are. why do i feel so alone?
"hello there. thank you for sharing your heart here. i want to start off by saying, in kind of an ironic way, your struggle is something many people go through, i might say quite often. many feel alone with one another quite frequently. the reasons for feeling alone vary much between person to person.
=====
im going through some things with my feelings and myself. i barely sleep and i do nothing but think about how i'm worthless and how i shouldn't be here. i've never tried or contemplated suicide. ive always wanted to fix my issues, but i never get around to it. how can i change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?
"it sounds like you are having some pretty severe depression. depression can cause insomnia, and make a person focus on their own perceptions that they are ""worthless"". it is important to remember that other people may not truly perceive you as worthless. this is the depression talking. i think that it is extremely important when you are this depressed, to sit down and write down some positives about yourself.
=====
does counseling really do anything that can help people?
"hi! great question. i believe counseling does help people! of course, i am a therapist, so i would think that! :) seriously - i think therapy and counseling allow us to understand ourselves, our motivations and the things that bring us happiness and discontent.
=====
i start counseling/therapy in a few days (im freaking out) but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?
"lots of people do cry in session, but your therapist wont be uneasy with this. crying is a natural response and it also releases toxins, so some might say it's necessary! remember that you can be in charge of what you talk about in your session and if there's something that feels too uncomfortable, just say, ""i'm not ready to talk about that."" your counselor wants you to feel at ease and will probably not push you right away to a very uncomfortable place. as you get to know your therapist, you will feel more relaxed and even not worry so much about how you appear to them.
=====
"how do you know you have the right therapist for you?  how would i know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what i need from treatment?"
"i think its crucial that a person finds the ""right"" therapist. questions, questions, questions! first i would ask them if they have experience and training in whatever the primary issues are that you are wanting to work on. you want to make sure the therapist has the skills and experience to help you. it's okay to ask ""have you worked with these issues before?""
=====
i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes. how can i start accepting myself and be more confident?
"the answer would require a more in-depth knowledge of you and your situation. a lot of times, these feelings are the result of the people in your life treating you a certain way. you internalize it and accept it as your reality. the first step is to evaluate the people close to you, especially your parents. even if you are an adult, think back to your childhood.

im feeling different towards my husband. i feel i am growing from the relationship. i have been with my husband for six years and married for almost five. i just don't feel that connection anymore. i feel nothing. i don't know why or if im just being irrational.
"your question seems to indicate something deeper is going on between you and your husband than you realized. first, let me say that you need to be really clear with some of your assumptions. too, quite a few of these assumptions are based on sound logic and if we believe they are all based on one false assumption. you also need to make sure that you and your husband are eating sensibly and generally. i bet you werent too happy with your relationship the first couple of weeks or so when you started dating.

there is just no communication at all between us. she sleeps constantly all day (not at night). she acts angry and unfocused and stays in her very messy room all the time. the only time she comes out is to eat. she has aches and fatigue, weight gain, hair loss and skin problems. she does not look after her health. i don't know how to communicate with her. she is not open to any suggestions. how do i get through to her?
"1. shes an adult.2. she lives in your house? she follows your rules.3. what you're describing could be any number of things, but could potentially be a medical issue that needs attention. thyroid issues, autoimmune diseases - there's a ton of medical possibilities for her symptoms.
=====
i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky. is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?
"thank you for your question. its completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session. many people report having felt this way. i can't say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session. for many people, it can take weeks, months, or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session.

it takes me a long time to fall asleep; i’d estimate about two hours. i often have nightmares, starting with being eaten by a monster, and i often wake up frightened and unable to breathe. i believe i started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of 8 years. also, my father’s business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition. i was under a lot of stress, and life lost meaning. after improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress, my symptoms improved. however in the past couple months, i started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning. how can i solve this issue?
"i agree with you! losing sleep usually happens as a result of changes in your life. i think the most important factor here is making sure that you are ""never too tired"" and ""not too tired"" when you need it most. if you are not sure whether you are losing sleep or not, consider finding out what is causing you to be ""too tired"" when you are not able to sleep or if you feel fine when you are. if you are having a difficult time remembering, you may be in denial of the changes.
=====
i have a friend that who i used to be in a relationship with. it was brief and turned into us being just good friends. i spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. was i wrong?
"the most important thing to ask yourself here is, ""how did this action affect my relationship, and is it worth the consequences?"" regardless of your intentions in this action, your boyfriend is uncomfortable with this type of behavior. from here, we can objectively decide if spending time with your previous partner (because that is likely what your boyfriend sees them as) is worth harming the relationship you currently have. it is very rare that a person would be comfortable with their partner spending more than a very little amount of time with their exes. many times, it just gives the wrong impressions.

i am a teenager, and my brother is a few years older. he has a girlfriend who is always with him. he never hangs out with me anymore. we were really close, and it is making me really sad.
"hi zionsville. its so sweet that you have a special relationship with your brother. you will always have that, you know? he's doing what's natural at his age...spreading his wings and looking for love. you may be heading into that zone soon too, but i get that it's weird that he's there before you, and you miss him.try to respect your brother's autonomy, wish him well, be friendly with his girlfriend, and it's also okay to say ""hey, bro, im still here.
=====
after i told them, they yelled at me.
"there are a lot of ways one could go about handling this kind of conflict. it is hard to know which way might be advisable if we dont know quite why they would yell (or, why would they care who you choose to sleep and/or partner with to begin with? )however, it is of utmost important that you accept yourself as bisexual, and sometimes that is easier said than done. but, when you are able to get to that acceptance that you are not in the majority in society as far as sexual orientation goes, and all that comes with that, and perhaps other issues you might have with it, it will be significantly easier for you to tolerate your family's lack of acceptance, and perhaps chalk it up to a severe lack of open-mindedness.but because it is family, and we don't choose our families but are forced to deal with them for the most part for better or worse (admittedly i'm not the biggest fan of outright estrangement), processing the loss of ""the family that i hoped i had"" will also be important for you moving forward in your life. you likely will be able to realize you really meant for them.
=====
if i tell him i dont like certain things, he does when it pertains to me. he tells me its not like that. he never has anything to say about me until i tell him something about himself.
"i am sorry to hear that you are feeling like you are being treated less than you deserve. i have come to believe that people who are ""too cool"" are going to stop liking you. there are some people who are more comfortable observing a particular environment, and these people will never quite get used to that. it seems that you want the relationship to work out for you. i guess that you are trying to figure out what you would like to/do differently.

its been almost a year since my ex-boyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me many times. i had found out about a month before, but i hadn't told him i knew because i didn't want us to break up. i used to have very low self-esteem, and i think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic. my father cheated on my mother when i was little. i wonder if this pain has to do with that. my ex-boyfriend and i were only dating for five months, but i still can't get over this betrayal. i'm not sure what to feel to get over it: forgiveness? hate? he helped me financially after our break up by lending me $3000, so i'm grateful for that. i still hate him for what he did and still want him to like me although we're not even talking anymore. we follow each other on instagram and that's it. i feel like i still need his validation. this is haunting me day and night. i want to focus on my new relationship and goals, but i keep obsessing over this and keep checking my ex-boyfriends instagram and facebook. i feel so bad and keep having nightmares.
"hi pocah!" oh dear, i get that, and you want him to feel good about leaving you. i feel terrible for you because you've suffered through such a betrayal, low self-esteem, and obsession. i have a few thoughts there that i would like to pass on to you. i have a few theories.he needs to be researched thoroughly.if your father was an alcoholic, it's a good idea to speak with a therapist so you can have a true relationship with him.

ever since i was little, i loved the idea of loving someone and spending my whole life with them. i treated everyone nice. for girls i liked, i would spend every second with them. it always ends the same way: “i like you as a friend,” or “i love your attention but not you.”
"hi cerritos,this is an interesting twist because its up to you if you went to live with your parents, grandmas, aunts, uncles, other relatives, it is common to have different definitions of ""i"" than there are issues that one person says to another. ask yourself ""why"" do i ""love girls?"" cn d the answers will give you clues as to why that is.the first thing to do is to be sure and be honest. it's common to stay with one person's opinion. it's possible you are having different things in your life (it and social in particular circles v makes everyone's world far away.

does counseling really do anything that can help people?
"hi! great question. i believe counseling does help people! of course, i am a therapist, so i would think that! :) seriously - i think therapy and counseling allow us to understand ourselves, our motivations and the things that bring us happiness and discontent.

i found out my boyfriend takes anti-depression medicine. lately hes been saying he has a lot on his mind, and he needs time to think about us. weve only been dating 3 weeks but i like him a lot.
"this seems like two questions. the first is what may have happened to prompt him to back off. the second is what it means to you to have a boyfriend who takes anti-depression medication who says he has ""a lot on his mind."" both give you opportunity to look at yourself. having expectations can be a huge trap.

i empathize so much, even with characters on tv or in video games, that i actually feel physical pain. this has made life difficult to say the least. i believe i have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder. but since its such a new disorder i cant find any information about it. could this be what is going on with me?
"hi there. it sounds to be a fairly new disorder. many people with this disorder use chemical shift Synapse, an AI program which helps them to track and interpret emotions. the idea being that you feel physical pain from your empathy to be aware of the changes that are happening within, as well as the way youre interpreting your feelings, you may be overreacting. no one is to blame you or that you are ""sitting on the jackson"" tv series.

i am not sure if i am depressed. i don't know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.
"i am so sorry you are struggling! i do think its a good idea to share your feelings with your parents and perhaps get some help connecting with a counselor or therapist if you feel that might help. there are lots of ways to tell them, depending on your relationship. maybe saying ""i wanted to tell you guys something.. sometimes i worry that i might be depressed."" or, some folks will write a letter, or even send a text.

i have so many issues to address. i have a history of sexual abuse, i’m a breast cancer survivor and i am a lifetime insomniac. i have a long history of depression and i’m beginning to have anxiety. i have low self esteem but i’ve been happily married for almost 35 years. i’ve never had counseling about any of this. do i have too many issues to address in counseling?
"thank you for sharing your question. i imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session. i would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals. for example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1. ""i will learn about the effects of medication on the symptoms of depression and anxiety.""2.

i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky. is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?
"thank you for your question. its completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session. many people report having felt this way. i can't say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session. for many people, it can take weeks, months, or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session.

im 17 and i'm sick and tired of going back and forth. i'd like to stay at my mother's house. this problem has really affected me. i've had anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts and self-harm in the past. currently im going through anxiety and my thearapist is not available. how do i handle this?
"at age 17, i think you are old enough to decide which parent you want to stay with full-time. i would gently and lovingly tell your father that youve decided to stay with your mother. you can offer to visit him regularly, if you'd like. parents often have a hard time letting go and, especially in divorce situations, your dad might feel as though he's ""lost the battle"" if you go live with your mom. he might also feel hes lost you.

ive worked with this guy for about three years now, and i knew the first time i saw him that i was attracted. over time, he became a very dear friend, and we talked about our relationship problems, family, dreams, and so on. there was always flirtation with us, and one day pretty recently, it progressed to making out. we agreed to keep it quiet, and we did, but in the back of my mind, i hoped it would become something more. it didn't, and three months later, i'm still not over it. i'm trying so hard to maintain the friendship because that's what he wants. we're no longer in the same office, which i thought would help me get over these feelings, but we still talk about work, and he's constantly touching me, so i'm still very drawn to him. he's a hugger and such a sweet guy, so i find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be, but he's clearly not interested. hes younger than me and prefers model types, but i see him checking me out a lot, which gives me hope. how do i get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship?
"hi bend, your situation is more common than you might imagine. what matters most is making the relationship work without him. all your effort you and he need to convince you that he is onto you. with that being said - ""i like watching my man do,"" what if he isnt interested in working with him? i get the sense that you are - that you don't want to be with him.

my boyfriend and i have been arguing every night about the same thing. he also tells me that if i go visit my mother out of state he will be gone when i get back. he and my mother do not get along. what should i do?
"hi california, i understand that you are confused by the whole situation. is he in texas this year? i wonder if he is at a loss for whether to take you places due to your relationship status. if he tells you he is concerned that he will be absent when you tell him he is home, is there a way for you to contact him and tell him so you can have a talk? it can be really frustrating not being clear where to go.i always encourage open communication to my clients.

how do therapists classify the type of personality their clients have? what characteristics do they look at to decide what type of personality the client has? ive read about this online, but i'd like to understand this from a therapists point of view.
"not very well :)so, you got the jungians, and you got the big fivers, and you got every manner of ivory-tower orc in between, loosening the chains on their drooling, snarling pet theories...the real truth is, does it matter? if it does, what does it matter?if it's still of keen interest to you, i would presume that god designed most of his creatures with a ""simpler set"" of personality blueprints; not a complex set as theorized by man;also realize that this level of reality is dualistic in nature; that means there is two of everything;so, imagine that whatever personalities you observe, and whatever words come to mind, also think of the opposite word, and you'll have a good sense of what actual personalities look like :)then, share your findings; itll be pretty neat to see what you come up with."" to find out a style and that is at the root, use your own style and see if the client is able to hold up a style and that whatever traits you decide, use those traits of the client are able to use in therapy to determine what type of personality traits of personality. you will have to have to come up with their own style and what the client prefer. this might mean using one characteristic of life, or a checklist of traits of personality traits of personality traits will influence the personality of the personality traits of personality traits that you find in the personality features that you want in the outcome you want to avoid.

i recently broke up with my boyfriend after being together for over 4 years. i truly believe i did the right thing, but omehow being single now has made me very needy and unsure of myself.  i am seeing someone casually and i am losing my mind with anxiety about how he feels about me and this need for validation. how can i learn to be content and at peace with myself regardless of my career, relationship status, etc?
"hi rockford, while there are some things that are more difficult, for example, not feeling respected in the relationship you recently ended, is a reminder that you are not making any progress in achieving the happiness you were after, and are anxious about being single.reflect a few years on aspects of self-understanding that may have been more slowly madegarden, you are more concerned with being admired and loving by others, about being treated less kindly, more concerned with being treated less than you deserve, and your overall sense of self-worth.are there any linger past issues from your relationship that this experience, or is it a matter of time? sometimes just the time, our mind will be more absorbed by the relationship, about the person, about the person, about the person in it, about the person, about us, and about our worth.the same is true about being more of a part of someone, any relationship.i would also add that if you would like to meet all of the issues youre having with someone, you would most likely be able to talk with them.also, many times people seek validation from friends and family. sometimes people look to make an effort to earn their money, but in reality, no one is a good fit, good or deserving of earning their money <extra_id_17> or a family member or even a friend. in truth. just look at the person who made you feel this way in believing that they will follow you.

i am divorced and happily remarried. our blended family of children are in their 20s. my youngest, age 20, continues to call me crazy and favors her dad. he was abusive to me, and i left with injuries. he never wanted kids, and i did. he paid child support only through forced wage earners. now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices i made for them the past 15 years as a single mom. i don’t deny them a relationship with their dad, but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core. i’m not sure how to handle this.
"it sounds really difficult to know that your daughter may be ""choosing"" her dad over you, perhaps i can help by saying her intense emotional reactions towards you actually acknowledge how much safer and connected she feels towards you. we tend to have big emotions around those we care for most. i would suggest to let her know how hard it is to hear that, and sad it make you feel at times, and that this is hard for everyone. expressing your feelings to here, will allow her to express hers too. ""i think youd find that the fact that you favored her over you, is a much better option than her.

its not entirely true to say i enjoy being sad, but i always find a way to feel that way. i listen to sad music, read tragic stories, and, in a twisted way, like how bad it makes me feel. i focus on negative aspects of my life even if they arent legitimate or i just make it seem negative.
"i wonder if you are having some twisted idea of your life being ""stuck"" in some one or another at the time of receiving that call. i wonder if you have imagined some aspect of your life as ""strange""... i wonder if you might be (or might be trying to be) (short for care) of self (short for care of self) that is creating your mood of the day/night/week/month/year/cycle of regard/attribulack.. you can be sad too (or happy) or happy...you can work on creating more happy streams...reflect on behalf of your life/family_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________luga_al___________hati die ...at ...i ...at___al____at___al____at_______at_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

"i keep having these random thoughts that i dont want. things like ""you aren't worth anything."" i know theyre my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it. what is wrong with me, and how can i stop having these thoughts?"
"i think we all go through a period of time where we think we arent worth anything. sometimes these feelings are a result of low self esteem or because of shame. the most important part of dealing with this thought is to separate feelings from reality. ""i don't feel worth anything, but i know what i do is important, i know who i am matters to others. i know i am loved and cared about.

i feel like i would be more comfortable as a girl even though i still like girls. i think im like a girl stuck in a guy body. i imagine myself as a girl too. i think this more because my friends say that if i was a girl i would be a hot looking one. and i dont care about having boobs or anything. i just feel like the way that i do act will make more sense if i was a girl.
"well, as much as i would like to add that getting a girl body would be desirable, the truth is that many girls don't feel comfortable in the way that many men feel. so, maybe you wouldnt feel as though you need to change up your body type, or adopt a more feminine one. there are many definitions of a girl body, but many people get caught up in a trap of expecting too much of yourself. this is not to say that you cant like girls or be them. i would, however, think that your body image is not who you want to be.

every winter i find myself getting sad because of the weather. how can i fight this?
"thank you for sharing. it seems like since the ""winter blues"" happens to you every year it may also be impacting your quality of life and possibly relationships. what you report sounds like you may be experiencing seasonal affective disorder (sad) and is quite common to many from about fall thru winter seasons; but, also can impact folks during the spring and summer months.the best care and treatment for sad includes discussing it with your pcp (primary care physician), integrating light therapy (full-spectrum lighting) throughout home and workplace (where possible), psychotherapy, and possibly medications (e.g. wellbutrin xl, aplenzin).be sure to exercise good self-care and checkout the mayo clinic's website for sad here: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/basics/definition/con-20021047."" perhaps you focus on these core issues when we can not really focus on a certain area or problem.one thing that i would suggest is a specific book you can read, ""the winter wonders of the winter season.""

when im in large crowds i get angry and i just can't deal with people. i don't really like other people (i prefer animals) they make me nervous and scared. i lay awake at night thinking and having conversations in my head and i almost always end up making myself feel terrible and crying, i have more conversions in my head than i do with actual people. i don't know whats wrong with me and why i feel this way. what should i do?
"the thing i picked up immediately in what youre asking is how you don't like other people because ""they make me nervous and scared."" if someone said that to me in a therapy session, i'd want to understand this much more with them, and what this ""nervous and scared"" experience is all about: perhaps starting with the question, ""what's the earliest memory you have of feeling uncomfortable around people."" the idea would be to try to understand all of what it means for you to be around people, and the history of the experience, without labeling it wrong or passing judgment on it.from there what might come is that certain people, and their character traits, might be harder to be around for you because of experiences that youve had with similar situations in your life. or, it could certainly be something completely different. it would be most important to understand it much more deeply considering the amount of distress it causes you, and in doing so we could begin to see it as ""normal for me."""

"i just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. my family and i really need this job. people keep telling me i have ""anxiety"" and i'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. this is all new to me. what can i do?"
"anxiety can cause such a feeling of discomfort in our bodies that it can seem unbearable. the concern that i can hear in what you have written is that the thought of having some anxiety has now left you uncomfortable with any anxiety at all - and that can become a problem, indeed. as opposed to thinking about your anxiety as something much bigger than you, it could be helpful to start breaking it down. what are the things specifically that cause you anxiety about this new job? is it being away from your family?

im in my late 50s. i never loved or have been loved. i need deeper help than is offered in my small town, but i cannot leave this town because of agoraphobia. i find myself losing hope more and more. my brain barely works anymore, and my memory so small, i forget in a moment. i serve no purpose. im incapable of work or anything of value, and i never have been. i’m a complete waste of time and resources, and yet i keep trying. why? why does god insist that i continue to exist? i’m not suicidal, just tired.
"as you are continuing to work through your issues, you are reminding yourself of your infinite struggles and blessings. from the way that you write here, it sounds like you are suffering from extreme dissociation from the way your body, mind, and spirit are connected and you are trying to find a balance. dissociation usually happens gradually and can be at any age. about the only time a person can be loved, nurtured, or cared for, it is usually because they are afraid of being loved. dissociation is often a sign that something so strongly shows in the lives of a person who have tried to offer love, tenderness, and self-compassion.

my husband used a lot of negative words to hurt me, and i moved out. he is seeing a counselor and wants another chance to make things right. i'm not sure if i trust that he will not go back to his old ways.
"hi savannah, this is a pretty common issue. i have had clients come to me with negative messages left and received, with no explanation given, as a result of unresolved conflict within the relationship. i understand that this is a sensitive and (again) proactive approach to unresolve conflict. its also reflective of a significant other who also specializes in dbt. its also reflective in your relationship.

i have family issues, and my dad was both violent and a cheater.
"hi new york, theres no way to keep your past from affecting your present and future, because it's a huge part of who we are. the good news is, though, that the effect doesn't have to be negative. i'm met many people who have horrific pasts and it helps them know confidently, every day, what kind of person they want to be and what kind of world they want to live in, and it helps them make really great decisions. you can accept your past, integrate your traumas and move forward in a very different way. if you see negative ways in which your past affects you (and this is also common), you are wise to seek professional help.

i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. i was very embarrassed.
"i also want to note that we, as a society, are especially judgemental about how women dress and present themselves. i am sorry that this boy said something insensitive. there is nothing shameful about your body and it was not your intention to ""display everything."" it also wasnt his place to judge you. as women we are expected to be sexy in some situations and demure in others.
