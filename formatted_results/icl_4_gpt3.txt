I'm a Christian teenage girl, and I have lost my virginity. My boyfriend is a Christian teenager too, but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner. I planned to abstain from sex but I guess I wasn't clear about this because I was also tempted and led him on. We continued to have sex. Does it mean that he isn't the one God planned for me?
It is important to know that the actions you take in life are not always indicative of your character. Your virginity does not make you less worthy of God's love.

How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?
Thanks for your question. Terminating a counseling relationship can be difficult. There are a few factors that go into it. First, the counselor may have reached a point where they feel that the client is not benefiting from the therapy. Second, the counselor may feel that the client is not meeting their professional obligations, such as keeping sessions on track, following through with homework, or keeping in contact. Finally, the counselor may feel that the relationship is not benefiting either party.

I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental. I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?
I think the first thing that you need to do is to seek professional help. It is difficult to quit smoking and you will need support to do so. Often times individuals are afraid of quitting because they do not know how to do it on their own. A therapist can help you to understand your addiction and provide you with tools to deal with cravings. Additionally, you may want to consider using nicotine replacement therapy such as nicotine gum or patches.

Congratulations!You are in an amazing relationship and it sounds like you both have a lot of mutual respect for each other. You are also lucky to have a partner who is open-minded and willing to move in with you.

I feel like I hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes. How can I start accepting myself and be more confident?
Unfortunately, it can be really hard to accept ourselves when we don't feel good about ourselves.

Once you have a better understanding of your thoughts, you can start to challenge them and start to change your thinking.

The past always feels much brighter and more beautiful than my present. Everything about what's gone feels so amazing; almost like I'm high off nostalgia. But in the end it just makes me feel sadder knowing that all of the memories (and a close friend that left me) are gone forever. How do I move past that and live more in the present?
I understand how you feel. When something we love is taken away, we are overwhelmed with sadness and longing. We remember the good times and we dwell on what we lost. This cycle of grieving creates a sense of detachment from the present.What you need to do is to let go of the past. When you focus on the present, you are able to appreciate the present more. You are also less likely to be overwhelmed by sadness in the future.This is a process that takes time and effort. You might find it helpful to write down your thoughts and feelings about the past. You can also talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these difficult feelings.

I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.
This is a difficult question. I think the first step is to be honest with yourself. What are some things that make you feel happy? What do you enjoy doing? What are some of your passions?

I've have lived for sometime with depression but things have gotten a lot better, but why is it so hard to get over anxiety and social isolation?
Hi, I'm sorry you're feeling this way. I think it's really tough to be struggling with both depression and anxiety, because they're both such big feelings. It's tough to know what to do. When I was feeling this way, it felt like I was stuck in a cycle of feeling really down and then trying to force myself to be OK again. It was really hard. What I recommend is that you talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you understand how these two things are connected. They may be able to help you figure out a plan to break the cycle and move forward. Talking to someone can also make you feel better, because you can tell them everything and they can help you figure out ways to deal with your feelings.

I was anxious to go to middle school. I was afraid of what people might say about me, so when school started, I wasn't acting like myself. I was quiet, which I'm usually not. I didn't talk to anybody and didn't have any friends. Then a few years later, my grandma died.
It sounds like your anxiety had a lot to do with how you were feeling during these different stages of your life. According to the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive anxiety and related symptoms that significantly interfere with daily life. In some cases, the anxiety is so severe that it leads to physical health problems, such as heart racing, shortness of breath, or nausea. From what you have written, it sounds like the anxiety from your experiences with bullying and your grandma's death led to a prolonged state of anxiety. Unfortunately, when we are anxious, our body goes into survival mode and we start to disconnect from our feelings and our surroundings. This can make it difficult to form new relationships because we are not able to share our feelings and we are not able to trust other people. There are many ways to address anxiety and its effects, and I would be happy to help you find the best approach for you.

I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it. I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling.

My spouse decided he no longer wanted me six years ago. Things have deteriorated so badly that we have separated but still live in the same house. He says he despises the sight of me, wants to be with other women, and divorce. What I don't understand is that he says constantly that I have no feelings for him and gets absurdly jealous if I speak to another male. Why does he constantly do these behaviors?
It sounds as if your husband has unresolved anger and resentment toward you. This anger can take many different forms, but one of the most common is a need for control. When he feels like he is losing control, he may react in a way that makes you feel unsafe or threatened. It may be difficult for you to understand why he does these things, but it is important to remember that your husband is not in control of his own emotions. He may be struggling with some deep-seated emotions that he is not able to express or deal with. It may be helpful for you to talk to a therapist about your situation.

Sometimes it can be difficult to come out to our families, but it is important that we do what is best for ourselves. Sometimes we are afraid of what our families will think, but in the end we should always put our happiness and well-being above anything else.

It's hard when relationships end and trust is broken.It's possible that your ex-boyfriend is struggling with his addiction and isn't able to handle his emotions in a healthy way.It's also possible that he's lying to you to cover up his behavior.It's important that you take the time to evaluate the situation and figure out what you want to do next.Talk to your friends and family for guidance.Be sure to document your thoughts and feelings in a journal so you can revisit them later.Try reaching out to him through text or social media, but be careful not to get too attached to the idea of a reconciliation.Sometimes the best thing to do is to take some time away and let things calm down.Good luck!

We argued a lot, and due to that, there was a lot of tension between us. We stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work. I used to party a lot, and several times I got into situations where I would end up kissing someone else.
It is understandable how after six years of trying, you would feel like giving up.Your boyfriend must have been through a lot too, trying to keep the relationship together when you were constantly going off track.It sounds like the tension between you was largely due to your own actions, not his. And even if he did have to deal with your behavior, that doesn't mean he doesn't love you. He may have had to put up with a lot but that doesn't mean he doesn't still care about you.And even though you have made mistakes in the past, they don't mean you're a bad person. Everyone makes mistakes. What matters is how you learn from them and try to change for the better.

I feel as though I'm suffering severe abandonment issues stemming from childhood. I convince myself I'm not worthy of happiness, and I’m always afraid I'm doing something wrong. It's as if I create little scenarios in my mind, and I start to believe them.
It sounds like you are obsessing over this issue and it's taking up a lot of your energy. I recommend that you seek professional help to address the root cause of your abandonment issues. A therapist can help you understand the thoughts and behaviors you're engaging in and provide you with strategies to cope with abandonment fears.

A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time. We talked for hours and she told me time and again that I was a great guy. She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality, etc. I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning. Now, though, I can't stop thinking about her, but I leave to go back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her.
It sounds like you really connected with this girl, and that her words were very affirming for you. Unfortunately, you will likely miss her when you're away at school. It's natural to feel anxious about leaving a good friendship behind, but try to remember that you will be able to talk to her online or in person when you're both back in town. In the meantime, take some time to reflect on what you learned from your conversation and how you can apply it to your own life.

My brother has been a heroin addict for years, and he’s now in his mid-30s. He has taken from me my mom and my grandparents. He's sick in the head. Now he moved his girlfriend into the house because they both manipulated us. Today, my mom and my brother went toe-to-toe over his girlfriend not helping around the house and always being high.
This sounds like a difficult situation. You may want to consider talking to a mental health professional to get some advice and help.

My therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here. However, my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends. I have loaned money to him many times, and he always paid me back. I had a medical emergency last weekend and I was heavily medicated. I knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me, but this therapist dropped me off and never came again.
Hi Adrienne, I'm sorry to hear about the issues you've experienced with your therapist. It sounds like you've been entrusting a lot of personal information to this person and they haven't been treating you fairly. It's important to have a trusting relationship with your therapist, but that doesn't mean you have to let them do anything they want. It's also important to have a safety plan in place in case of an emergency. You might want to consider talking to a friend or family member about what to do in case of an emergency and have a list of phone numbers handy. You can also reach out to the National Sexual Assault Hotline for more resources.

On the first day of school I wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like I had bigger boobs. I did that the whole school year and my parents never found out. But now I can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest. How do I fix this?
It sounds like you feel really embarrassed and exposed by this. It's understandable that this has created a lot of anxiety for you.It's possible that wearing a bra that is too big for your body, created a false sense of security.

It sounds like you would like to be able to hang out with your friends and not feel like you are hiding something.

I just got out of a two year relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend because he wasn't showing any affection at all. He was talking to other women and lying about it. It pushed me away and hurt me, but I'm still in love with him. A couple days after our breakup, he was talking to someone new.
It sounds like you are still in love with him and that this new person has brought up painful memories for you.If this is the case, it would be best to stay away from him and focus on healing from the breakup. In the meantime, try to take care of yourself emotionally by talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you understand and process the pain you are feeling. You deserve to get the support you need to heal.

Thank you for sharing your story. This is a difficult issue to talk about, but it is important to do so. When we feel lost or don't know who we are, we may find comfort in relationships or in following the path we were told to by our parents or other authority figures. Unfortunately, this can often lead to a sense of complacency or false security. It can be helpful to talk to a counselor or priest/pastor about your feelings in order to gain a deeper understanding of yourself and to find a new path.

I stress over everything. If I don't have enough "quality time" with my boyfriend, I start to feel resentment towards him. He has three children, and they are great kids, but I find we don't have much time together. I break down easily and find myself depressed.
Sounds like you are taking on too much and not allowing yourself to have enough time for yourself. Schedule in some time each week where you will devote uninterrupted time to yourself. This could be 30 minutes, an hour, or even all day. Include activities you enjoy, people you care about, and moments that make you feel peaceful and satisfied. When you prioritize your time, you will be less likely to stress and feel resentful.Also, make sure to talk to your boyfriend about your concerns and share with him what you would like from your relationship. Discussing your goals and expectations allows you to have a more positive view of your relationship and makes it easier to find solutions to problems.

I was in a relationship with a woman for four years. We both made mistakes, but I do love her. She has moved in with another lady. I think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her. How can I find out for sure?
There is no one answer to this question. If you are feeling like she is cheating on you, it might be a good idea to talk to her about your feelings. If she denies cheating, it might be helpful to have a friend or family member watch you talk to her in order to make sure you are being truthful and not getting upset or defensive in a way that would make it difficult to get an accurate answer from her.

Our relationship ended about 7 years ago, but don't know how to let go. How can I get over that person and move on?
Hi, I understand that you are struggling with letting go. Unfortunately, the way you are handling this situation is making it much harder. When a relationship ends, it's normal to feel some range of emotions, but for you to still be hanging onto this person is not healthy. I would recommend that you start by writing down all of the reasons why you ended the relationship and then reading them out loud.
