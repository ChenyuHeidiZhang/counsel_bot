===== BATCH 1 =====
=== 41 ===
My older brother (in his 60s) started dating a lady with Asperger's. She is hyper-sexual and flirty. She does not understand boundaries.
I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but Asperger's is a developmental disorder.
=== 42 ===
After 25 years, I fell in love for the first time. The person acted for a week and left me without even saying goodbye. My heart is burning, and I can't take this pain.
I'm sorry to hear that.
=== 43 ===
I've recently thought that i could be transgender but I've never had the mind of a girl.
I'm sorry to hear that. You are a counselor and your client approach you with their concern.
=== 44 ===
I got sick really bad and was throwing up for three days and nights. I thought I was going to die. Then about a week later, I started having this desire to be female.
This is a good question.
=== 45 ===
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?
I would say that the counselor should be able to make a decision based on the client's needs and the counselor's ability to provide the best possible service.
=== 46 ===
I'm a guy. If I don't like girls, nor do I like guys, does that mean I'm gay?

They discontinued treatment for no apparent reason after they thought to diagnose me with schizophrenia.
I'm sorry, but I don't think that's a valid diagnosis.
=== 48 ===
I am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life. I had a daughter with my ex-boyfriend. I am now married, and my husband’s ex-girlfriend is involved with my ex-boyfriend.
I have been with my ex-boyfriend for over a year.
=== 49 ===
After 40 years of being straight, how could I now find myself interested in people of the same sex? I have had a few same sex encounters of my own doing.
You are right.
=== 50 ===
I am a heterosexual male in my late 20s. I find myself wearing pantyhose, heels, skirts and other women's clothing in private. I am torn on how to feel about it.
I think you are right.
=== 51 ===
We kissed and he grabbed my boobs and we exchanged some texts and a few calls. It went on for about 8 months. Just when we were all together and our spouses were out of the room.
I think it's important to remember that you are not alone.
=== 52 ===
I have secrets in my mind, and I don't know what to do with them. I don't want to tell my wife and mom because I don't want to hurt them. But I'm not sure how long that I can keep the secret to myself.
Is it possible you simply didn't mix well with the particular therapists with whom you've worked? If this is possible, interview a therapist before starting therapy.
=== 53 ===
My issue isn't resisting angry urges; it's the anger itself. My rage is extreme and vastly disproportionate to the direct stressor. It causes violent thoughts, but I never act.
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm not sure how to help you. I'm not sure how to help you.
=== 54 ===
She treats me like I'm not in her presence. She’s always yelling at me for no reason. She gives more respect to my brothers than me, but only my brothers fight her while I respect her.
I don't think it's appropriate to give your counselor a bottle of wine. Your counselor helped you and supported you, which is great, But a gift is inappropriate. I can understand that you want to show your gratitude.
=== 55 ===
My boyfriend’s sneaky and puts his friends before me. He fights just to leave. One day, he's happy.
You are right, he is a good person. You can try to be more open and honest with him about his actions and how he feels about them.
=== 56 ===
I'm a guy. If I don't like girls, nor do I like guys, does that mean I'm gay?
I'm not sure if you're gay or not, but I'm sure you're not.
=== 57 ===
I need answers to my anger, possessiveness, and urges. I am angry all the time. I push people away so much that I actually blow up on people now because they ask me how my day is or was.
I have been in therapy for years and have learned to deal with my anger and other emotions.
=== 58 ===
I've been with a man for four years. For the last year, he has said he is done, but he still talks, texts, visits, and has not moved on with anyone else. His words do not match his actions.
You are right, but I'm not sure if you are right about the man.
=== 59 ===
The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.
I'm glad you have some time when you're not thinking about your trauma when you're with your friends.
=== 60 ===
My suppose-to-be father told me to go find my real dad. We haven't been getting along since I was a teenager. If I said one thing that he thought was wrong, I always got degraded.
Have you tried to talk about the subjects of the past, in the present at a time in which there is no heat between the two of you?Since your gf would like to resolve situations from the past the best way to do so would be to talk about them. The more you try to avoid certain subjects the more likely they will come up between you at worse possible moments.If you can get ahead of the pattern of old topics coming up without your control, then try scheduling a discussion about them. This by itself will show your gf you care about what she cares about and this may be one quality she would feel good about.
===== BATCH 2 =====

I told him I liked him. He called me lovely and pretty but he said he didn’t want a relationship. He would always flirt with me.

=== 42 ===
My son stole my debit card and lied about it. It's not the first time he has lied. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I should punish him or make him do something. I've tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong.
I'm sorry, but I don't think you should punish him.
=== 43 ===
I'm a Christian teenage girl, and I have lost my virginity. My boyfriend is a Christian teenager too, but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner. I planned to abstain from sex but I guess I wasn't clear about this because I was also tempted and led him on. We continued to have sex. Does it mean that he isn't the one God planned for me?
I think that's a very important question.
=== 44 ===
We do communicate but one of us has trouble accepting what the other person says. How can I fix things?
You are not alone.
=== 45 ===
My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?

I'm an adult, facing problems with my mom. She's way too controlling. She decides things for me, disregarding whatever I say. I tried explaining my side to her calmly, but she eventually gets angry and doesn't wish to listen to me regardless of how I speak to her.
I think it would be wise for you to call a hotline especially designed for children.
=== 47 ===
I have been with this guy on and off for 8 years. At first, we used to do things together and our sex life was ok. Then things started to change, we'd break up and reconnect, and he cheated on me numerous times. We've also had two beautiful baby girls during this time. Now we argue and he says I am not affectionate at all or I don't know how to please a man, when I work part-time, take care of a 2 year old and a 5 month old and cook. Sometimes he cooks, but he also spends a lot of time on the internet.
What do you think is the most important thing you can do to help your partner understand that he is not affectionate?
=== 48 ===
My boyfriend and I have a terrible sex life after three years of dating, and I don't know what to do. I have this lingering fear of pain during sex after having two partners previously who weren't careful. How can I stop projecting this onto my current boyfriend?
The best way to manage your anxiety is to learn to control your thoughts and feelings.
=== 49 ===
I keep hearing I am attractive from people around me, and I think I believe it. But I have low confidence regarding approaching girls I like.
I know you are feeling a little down, but I think you are just being too sensitive.

My dad beat and mentally abused me so badly that I can't function properly. Letting go of the past is important to moving on and getting better, but I’m terrified to get better because I don't even know who I am without the trauma. I've never gotten to be myself. I don't even know who I am.
I am so sorry that you have to go through this. I hope you can find a therapist who can help you to heal from your trauma.

I'm always told I'm not good enough or trying hard enough. I put 100% in to every thing. I'm worn out, I've worked on all of my family relationships, I'm doing great in school, I'm kind to those in need and otherwise. I stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so I don't have to make as many and the ones I do I learn from. Somehow it's still not good enough and nothing I do works.
I'm not sure if you're right.

On the first day of school I wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like I had bigger boobs. I did that the whole school year and my parents never found out. But now I can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest. How do I fix this?
I recommend that you seek professional services to address the trauma you experienced. EMDR has been proven to be very effective in treating trauma. In addition, a support group might be helpful to find a more stable support network. Either a support group for victims of rape or sex/love addiction www.sa.org sound appropriate. Whichever group resonates the most with you will be the most helpful.

My wife just last week said she wants a divorce and it's all sudden. I understand that marriages have their ups and downs but I don't understand why she can't tell me why she wants a divorce. Should I fight for my family (daughter and wife)?
I understand how you feel. When someone decides to end a relationship, it can be a very difficult process. Your wife may have been feeling this way for a while and she may have decided that it is now the best time for her and her daughter. It is not your place to "fight for your family" as this is something that your wife needs to deal with. You should support her in whatever decision she makes and make sure that you are both okay.

I just wanted to get to know one so I can hear about their college experience and the courses they took. I also wanted to know if they enjoy their job and how long they were in school.
Hi, and thank you for your question. When it comes to the types of questions you are asking, it is generally acceptable to ask someone about their education and job. However, it is important to be thoughtful about the questions you ask. Questions such as "did you like your classes?" or "do you have a lot of fun at work?" can be intrusive and can be seen as nosy. It is also important to be aware of the fact that people often share more personal information when they are comfortable with the person they are talking to. When you are interested in someone, try to take the time to get to know them better.

After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now he is depressed and hopeless again.
Sounds like your client has had a roller coaster of emotions since their hospital discharge. It's natural for people to go through a range of emotions after a traumatic experience like this. Sometimes people feel wonderful and happy for a short period of time, only to relapse into depression or feeling hopeless. It can be difficult to know what to do when someone goes through a fluctuation in emotions like this. One thing you can do is to be there for your client, listening to them and offering support.Also, it's important to remember that everyone experiences emotions differently and there is no one right way to feel. Sometimes people need time to adjust to the changes that have taken place. Sometimes people need to talk about what is going on.

I feel so irritated and frustrated because of it. I get so angry to the point that I feel like I'm going to explode. I feel pathetic, stupid, and worthless. I just can't take this anymore.
Hi, I'm here for you. It's normal to feel frustrated, angry, and worthless when your emotions are in the grip of this intensity. It feels like your whole world is collapsing and you can't escape. It's also hard to be around people when you're like this. What would you like to do about it?

My son stole my debit card and lied about it. It's not the first time he has lied. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I should punish him or make him do something. I've tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong. I have grounded him, but nothing works. What should I do?
Your son sounds like a very challenging child.I have heard of family counseling being beneficial.Has your son told you his reasons for lying?Is he blaming others or is he pointing fingers at himself?It sounds like he may have some self-blame. Is there someone whom you can talk to about this?The most important question is whether there is any improvement in his behavior.If he continues to lie and is blaming others, then it sounds like he needs some more intensive therapeutic help.Lying and blaming others is an indication of a more general problem with self-esteem.He may very well be a wonderful person.This behavior is not who he is.Maybe he feels that he has to live up to some standard that he doesn't feel worthy of.If he can find someone who understands him to talk to and if he can find a therapist who can help him improve his self-esteem and sense of worth, then he may be able to make great progress.Good luck!

I'm being verbally abused on a daily basis by my parents in front of my child. I feel like I’m trapped and I have no escape. I feel like I have to listen to the horrible things they say and just take all of it. I need some way of learning how to cope with listening to it especially since I have nowhere else to go. I feel very emotionally drained How can I deal with this?
First of all, I am so sorry that you are going through this. You are not trapped, and you do have an escape, in fact there are a lot of places that you can go. It is important to remember that you can leave at any time, even if you are running late. You can also leave at any time during the day. So, before you begin to let the verbal abuse affect you, try to create a plan. Make sure that the plan includes at least one person you can call and that person should be another adult. If you can, try to leave with that person, but if you have to stay, try to have a place where you will be safe. If you can, consider leaving with a friend that you can trust. If you are physically unable to leave, try to remember that you can leave. It may be hard to remember that at first, but you can get back to a place where you feel safe. Remembering that you can leave at any time is the most important thing to remember. As far as how you should cope with the verbal abuse, I recommend a book by Lynn Staley called, Speaking to An Abuser: How Families Can Stop Living in Fear and Start Getting Their Lives Back. This book is extremely helpful and I would encourage you to read it. Also, you may want to consider seeing a counselor. If you are still struggling after reading this, please call the Counselors Hotline: 844-487-4899. There are many counselors that are extremely helpful. Hope this helps! Be safe! Robin J.

I think about death all the time because I feel so alone. I want someone to love and someone to love me.
Give yourself love and trust that you will receive love and trust.Life is made up of a series of relationships, either intimate or social. The more we interact with others, the more we have a feeling of being loved and loving others.I suggest you increase the amount of time you spend with people who you feel are loving and trustworthy. Then you will feel less alone.Also, in the interest of loving and trusting others, ask people you know for help. People are more likely to help someone who is in need of their help.Also, I suggest practicing being kind and loving to yourself. This is harder than asking for help. Start by saying nice things about yourself and then practice.Finally, life is about making choices. If your most difficult choice is to find someone to love and be loved by, I suggest you do the best job you can of finding love and learning how to give and receive love.Good luck in your search! :)¿Cómo puedo encontrar a alguien que me ame?

I feel like I took our relationship for granted and he's now to the point that he's giving up. I have had trouble feeling like I could trust him but he's given me no reason not to trust him. I know my attitude is also a big issue for him. I have a lot of obligations at home so we don't spend a lot of time together. How can I fix this relationship?
It may be helpful to see a couples therapist, as a couple to help you both address the specific concerns you have. A therapist can help you to be supportive of each other and can help you to address your individual concerns. A therapist can also help you to identify ways to strengthen your relationship and can help you to set boundaries. If you are unable to see a therapist, your boyfriend may want to consider seeing a therapist to address his concerns and help him to find ways to express his needs. A therapist may also be able to help him to identify ways for you to learn to trust him and ways for you to have better communication. I'm glad that you are able to see that you have some trust issues. The good news is that you can work on that with help. Also, you may want to consider talking to him about what you see as good things in the relationship and what you would like to see in the relationship moving forward. Sometimes talking about the positive things that you see in your relationship can be a good way to communicate that you value it and can help to communicate that you want to make it better. I wish the best of luck to you!

I have these dreams of men, and they always seem to try to hurt me. It's gotten so bad that I first wake at 4:30, then 4:45, and finally stay awake by 6:00. I'm always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake. I hate falling asleep. The longest I've went without sleep is three days.
There are many theories as to why we have nightmares. Perhaps you are able to recognize and work through some of your own thoughts and emotions. The most common theory is that nightmares represent a combination of our fears, thoughts, and emotions while we are sleeping. Try to understand what frightens you the most, what thoughts you are having during the nightmare, and how you feel when you wake up. Some nightmares are recurring, so it may be helpful to ask yourself what the main themes are in these recurring nightmares. Once you are able to identify your own thoughts and emotions that are connected to your nightmares, it may be easier to understand and work through them. There are many ways to work through a nightmare, but it may be helpful to talk about it with a trusted friend, family member, or therapist. If you are able to understand what is causing you distress, you may be able to find a solution to the problem that is causing the stress.

Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram, iMessage, or snapchat people will read my messages but then they won't answer me. Could it be that there is something they don't like about me? I don't understand why they won't answer my messages. How do I get people to respond to me?
Hi there. This is a really common question and a really common pitfall people have when trying to build relationships. You are right - they might not be replying because they don't like you. But, is it possible they don't know who you are? This is often the case. There are many people on social media sites who message, and don't know each other in real life. You can take the time to research them, figure out why they're not replying, and then reach out again. Another factor here is timing. When you send the message, does the other person get it immediately? Or, does it take a few minutes for them to see it? The timing of the message is important. If it's only going to take a few minutes for them to read your message, and they are already in the middle of something else, you're not going to get a response. But, if you send it when they are available, you're more likely to get one. Another thing to consider is if this person has a public or private account. With some social media sites, if you have a public account and someone else doesn't, you're not going to be able to see each other's messages. With Snapchat and Instagram, however, you are both seeing each other's messages. If someone doesn't respond to you, don't get frustrated and assume they're ignoring you. They might not even know who you are. And, if they do know who you are, they might not want to be your friend, or they might not like you. These are all possibilities, but they're not facts. Another thing to consider is whether this person is really interested in you or not. Sometimes you can have the impression that people are interested, but in actuality they're not. If you're starting to feel frustrated by not getting the response you want, there are many other ways to connect with people in your life. Go out for coffee with a friend, stop in the store to say hi to a total stranger, or reach out to someone on social group that you know. We are all connected in some way, so it's always possible to build new relationships. Be well.Robin J.

I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.
I think that is a very common question people ask. There are different ways to answer that question. The first would be to look at your own life and look at what has happened in your life, what have you learned from that, what has affected you? That could also be in looking at family, friends, or even what you watch on television. There are different ways to answer that question. The next would be to ask someone who knows you well or someone you just met and see what they think you are and see what they say. Also, you could look at yourself in a mirror or a camera and just play around with different answers and see what you come up with. But, the best way to find out is by asking someone else. You can also look at a book or website that has different personalities and see what you are like as a person. If you are not sure what you are, take a chance and find out. You may be surprised what you find out. You may be just who you are supposed to be. Robin J.

My dad passed away when I was a teenager. I never got any help, and five years later, I feel like I can't handle it anymore.
"I am so sorry to hear of your father's passing. I can imagine that there is a lot going on right now. You mention that you ""never got any help, and five years later, I feel like I can't handle it anymore"" - sounds like you might want to reach out to a therapist. You're right that it can be difficult to cope with the loss of a loved one and it doesn't sound like you have any help to cope with this loss - that is a good sign that you are ready to seek out some help. Reaching out for help is never easy and I hope that you have the support of friends and family members. They are often the first ones to reach out and be there for us. I hope you will reach out for support. Good luck!

I suffer from adult ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depression. It has been difficult to find a doctor in my area and my primary physician won't help. I am unemployed and overwhelmed. What would you suggest I do?
You may be able to find support within your area by looking for a therapist who specializes in ADHD and depression. I recommend searching for counselors on sites like Psychology Today and calling to ask if they offer sliding scale fees. You may also want to reach out to local hospitals and see if they have any counselors or therapists who may be able to help you. I hope you find a therapist who is able to help you through these difficult times. If you are unable to find someone, you may want to consider getting some counseling online. You may find some great counseling websites which offer free counseling if you are unable to pay. You can find some of these sites by doing a search for counseling websites which offer free counseling.~Laura~www.Help-Self-Heal.comwww.Living-Life-With-Depression.comwww.Living-Life-With-ADHD.comwww.Living-Life-With-Anxiety.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.Living-Life-With-ADHD.comwww.Living-Life-With-Anxiety.comwww.Living-Life-With-Depression.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.

I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.
Anxieties are a bit of a catch all for many different sources of stress. Talking with a therapist can help you gain tools and strategies to manage your anxieties. It may also be helpful to look at the different areas of stress and develop strategies to effectively manage each area. This may require different strategies and goals depending on the area. Another option is to develop a self-care plan that allows you to effectively manage the areas of stress while building self-efficacy in areas such as managing relationships and stress. This self-care plan may include relaxing activities, rewarding yourself, and planning/prioritizing. A therapist can also help you integrate these strategies into your life and make sure they are working effectively. There are also many apps that are available to help you plan and track your self-care activities. These may be a good option if they help you incorporate self-care into your life while still managing other areas of stress. Also, being mindful of your stress is a good way to manage stress. Mindfulness is one way to increase your awareness of your current mental state and teach you skills for self-regulation. There are also many websites and apps that can help you learn mindfulness. It is important to note that mindfulness is not a panacea and should not be used to replace the use of effective strategies such as self-management plans. If you are interested in learning more about mindfulness and how it can help you manage stress, I would recommend reading Mindfulness for Dummies or Mindfulness for Insomniacs, both of which can help you learn the benefits of mindfulness. There are many different apps that are also available to help you practice mindfulness. Another option is to talk with your therapist about whether they can help you learn mindfulness. If you are interested in learning more about self-care planning, I would recommend reading 9 Things Successful People Do Every Day, by Debbie Ford. She talks about making it a part of your routine. The links provided are only a few of the many things that are out there. Hopefully this was helpful and some of these resources may be of use. I would love to hear about how you are managing your anxieties. If you would like to talk, I can be reached at 757-619-1717 or email me at anyhcounselor@live.

On the first day of school I wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like I had bigger boobs. I did that the whole school year and my parents never found out. But now I can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest. How do I fix this?
I'm glad that you know that you would like to have boobs. I think you made a wise choice in wearing a bra that gave the appearance of having boobs. If you are willing to wear a bra that is the correct size for your chest, you can keep that appearance and enjoy being with your friends in your house. You can also appreciate your friends noticing your new chest. It sounds like you are very aware of your actions and are willing to change your behaviors as you would like to. This is very positive. I would encourage you to make an appointment with a therapist who specializes in helping teens with this issue. You may be able to learn how to manage your anxiety and protect your privacy by learning ways to enjoy your new chest.

About 3 years ago or so I was skinny, but I was still ugly. I really do want to change that but I've tried 3 times. Now can I try but don't stop. At school I get bullied about my weight and my ugliness and I have been bullied my whole life that I believe them. How can I stop thinking about them and don't let it get in my head? My parents said I don't weight that much but, they do think I am fat but, they tell me I am not. I told my parents that I need to go to a therapist, but they think I am fine and I think they don't want to deal with it.

i have so many issues to address. i have a history of sexual abuse, i’m a breast cancer survivor and i am a lifetime insomniac. i have a long history of depression and i’m beginning to have anxiety. i have low self esteem but i’ve been happily married for almost 35 years. i’ve never had counseling about any of this. do i have too many issues to address in counseling?
"thank you for sharing your question. i imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session. i would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals. for example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1. ""i will learn about the effects of medication on the symptoms of depression and anxiety.""2.

"hi texas,when you have a new id, you can't use it right away, but i would recommend working w some other family members or get them to agree to help you find a new id. there are some issues that need to be worked through before you can move forward. i would recommend working with a local therapist or other professional as your husband may be experiencing. you may also need the help of a doctor or a therapist as they can't do that for you. if your husband is a regular driver (ie.e.e., i'm a term this is a good thing) to get back on time, or until you have a new i get back on time.whart brach : :):) :) patience:) and patience:) will always be there for you (i hope he will be able to make the next step.

"hi, yes i see your point of view of ""not quite pulling the wool over your eyes"". human beings are social creatures who secretly love their selves. so your question is somewhat new. you may want to keep looking at your ""elements"" to see if they have any additional thoughts or sense of who you are. i do not know whether you are or were just recently diagnosed with a diagnosis of bipolar, but if at this time it is within the realm of possibility that your doctor may be focused on the diagnosis.

"your trust issues are causing too many problems on your own. some of the problems are the way you handle communication in relationships, the jealousy and isrs youve noticed in your fiances behaviours, the guilt and anxiety he feels since youve told the bulls-eye (see below picture), the jealousy/stunchaining that seems to be happening more often than you would like, and the problems are getting in the way. i don't know how old you are, but i can tell you that most likely he's honest with you, and he's trying to make it look and sounds very dangerous. he may be more interested in discussing the relationship than you are. he may prefer to discuss the benefits of talking about it in a more transparent way, with you where you can talk about it, while you can discuss how you can help him to trust you more, and how to communicate in a non-boyfriend.

Suicide is not a natural way to pass from this Earth, so many times it can be EXTREMELY tough to deal with because of the "unnatural-ness" of the event. We may find ourselves feeling guilty that we did not see it or that we could've done more or something to stop it, but often the fish in the fishbowl cannot see that which is closest to him. You are currently trying to numb your feelings, those feelings as nasty as they are, are meant to be felt, those feelings help us to process the event and also help us to pass through the situation.

Thank you for your question. It sounds like you are facing a lot of tough challenges. I encourage you to keep talking to your therapist. In addition, many agencies or programs that provide mental health services offer intake forms that may be a good resource for you. In addition, there are many online resources that may be helpful.

I know that I need to get past my feelings for this person I fell in love with, but t's so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings I've never felt before. I feel like I don't want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, I know I need to be without him. I can't discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered "wrong" by a lot of people. How can I get myself to just move on?
It can be really tough to let go of someone you care for. It sounds like you care deeply for this person and you don't want to lose that love. While it is understandable to feel this way, it is important to remember that love is not conditional and can survive even if the relationship is not healthy. You may want to consider talking to a counselor or therapist who can help you work through these feelings in a safe and supportive environment.

I'm worried I should see a therapist due to past events and current mental status. I'm just so unsure of how to ask my doctor about seeing someone.
Hi, It is perfectly normal to feel uncertain about whether or not you need to see a therapist. Sometimes, it's helpful to talk about these feelings with a trusted friend or family member before making a decision. However, if you feel like you need professional help, it is important to seek out a therapist who is certified by the American Mental Health Counselors Association (AMHCA). This will ensure that they have the necessary training and experience to provide you with the best possible treatment. Thank you for reaching out, and I wish you the best of luck in your decision.

My spouse decided he no longer wanted me six years ago. Things have deteriorated so badly that we have separated but still live in the same house. He says he despises the sight of me, wants to be with other women, and divorce. What I don't understand is that he says constantly that I have no feelings for him and gets absurdly jealous if I speak to another male. Why does he constantly do these behaviors?
It sounds as if your husband has unresolved anger and resentment toward you. This anger can take many different forms, but one of the most common is a need for control. When he feels like he is losing control, he may react in a way that makes you feel unsafe or threatened. It may be difficult for you to understand why he does these things, but it is important to remember that your husband is not in control of his own emotions. He may be struggling with some deep-seated emotions that he is not able to express or deal with. It may be helpful for you to talk to a therapist about your situation.

I was born a girl, but I want to be a boy. Because of my religion I can't tell my family. I know they won't accept me. What do I do?
I think the first thing you should do is talk to your bishop. It may be that there is a bishop in your area who can assist you in this. Sometimes it can be difficult to come out to our families, but it is important that we do what is best for ourselves. Sometimes we are afraid of what our families will think, but in the end we should always put our happiness and well-being above anything else.

My boyfriend and I recently broke up. One week, we were fine, and the next, he told me he needed space. He completely deleted me out of his life. He does have an opiate addiction. He claimed he was sober, but since we've split, I've heard many lies from him.
It's hard when relationships end and trust is broken.It's possible that your ex-boyfriend is struggling with his addiction and isn't able to handle his emotions in a healthy way.It's also possible that he's lying to you to cover up his behavior.It's important that you take the time to evaluate the situation and figure out what you want to do next.Talk to your friends and family for guidance.Be sure to document your thoughts and feelings in a journal so you can revisit them later.Try reaching out to him through text or social media, but be careful not to get too attached to the idea of a reconciliation.Sometimes the best thing to do is to take some time away and let things calm down.Good luck!

I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now. In the past, our relationship was difficult and frustrating. We argued a lot, and due to that, there was a lot of tension between us. We stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work. I used to party a lot, and several times I got into situations where I would end up kissing someone else.
It is understandable how after six years of trying, you would feel like giving up.Your boyfriend must have been through a lot too, trying to keep the relationship together when you were constantly going off track.It sounds like the tension between you was largely due to your own actions, not his. And even if he did have to deal with your behavior, that doesn't mean he doesn't love you. He may have had to put up with a lot but that doesn't mean he doesn't still care about you.And even though you have made mistakes in the past, they don't mean you're a bad person. Everyone makes mistakes. What matters is how you learn from them and try to change for the better.

I feel as though I'm suffering severe abandonment issues stemming from childhood. I convince myself I'm not worthy of happiness, and I’m always afraid I'm doing something wrong. It's as if I create little scenarios in my mind, and I start to believe them.
It sounds like you are obsessing over this issue and it's taking up a lot of your energy. I recommend that you seek professional help to address the root cause of your abandonment issues. A therapist can help you understand the thoughts and behaviors you're engaging in and provide you with strategies to cope with abandonment fears.

A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time. We talked for hours and she told me time and again that I was a great guy. She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality, etc. I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning. Now, though, I can't stop thinking about her, but I leave to go back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her.
It sounds like you really connected with this girl, and that her words were very affirming for you. Unfortunately, you will likely miss her when you're away at school. It's natural to feel anxious about leaving a good friendship behind, but try to remember that you will be able to talk to her online or in person when you're both back in town. In the meantime, take some time to reflect on what you learned from your conversation and how you can apply it to your own life.

My therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here. However, my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends. I have loaned money to him many times, and he always paid me back. I had a medical emergency last weekend and I was heavily medicated. I knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me, but this therapist dropped me off and never came again.
Hi Adrienne, I'm sorry to hear about the issues you've experienced with your therapist. It sounds like you've been entrusting a lot of personal information to this person and they haven't been treating you fairly. It's important to have a trusting relationship with your therapist, but that doesn't mean you have to let them do anything they want. It's also important to have a safety plan in place in case of an emergency. You might want to consider talking to a friend or family member about what to do in case of an emergency and have a list of phone numbers handy. You can also reach out to the National Sexual Assault Hotline for more resources.

I have bipolar disorder, paranoid personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. I last self-harmed a week ago. When I am stressed, overwhelmed, hurt, or angry, the urge to self-harm is all I can think of. I am trying to seek help.
It sounds like you're in a difficult situation.It's normal to feel scared, overwhelmed, and confused.You may find relief in talking about your feelings.Talking about your feelings can help you to feel more in control and less distressed.If you're not currently in counseling or therapy, I suggest that you consider seeking out professional help.Counseling or therapy can help you understand and manage your feelings more effectively.

On the first day of school I wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like I had bigger boobs. I did that the whole school year and my parents never found out. But now I can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest. How do I fix this?
It sounds like you feel really embarrassed and exposed by this. It's understandable that this has created a lot of anxiety for you.It's possible that wearing a bra that is too big for your body, created a false sense of security. This could make it difficult for you to feel comfortable in your own skin and it could also cause you to feel self-conscious about your chest.Your parents never found out because you were careful not to let them see. It sounds like you would like to be able to hang out with your friends and not feel like you are hiding something. It's possible that talking to your parents about this, could help them to understand what is going on for you and to help you feel more comfortable. In the meantime, it might be helpful to find a therapist who can help you work through these feelings.

I just got out of a two year relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend because he wasn't showing any affection at all. He was talking to other women and lying about it. It pushed me away and hurt me, but I'm still in love with him. A couple days after our breakup, he was talking to someone new.
It sounds like you are still in love with him and that this new person has brought up painful memories for you.If this is the case, it would be best to stay away from him and focus on healing from the breakup. In the meantime, try to take care of yourself emotionally by talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you understand and process the pain you are feeling. You deserve to get the support you need to heal.

I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.
Thank you for sharing your story. This is a difficult issue to talk about, but it is important to do so. When we feel lost or don't know who we are, we may find comfort in relationships or in following the path we were told to by our parents or other authority figures. Unfortunately, this can often lead to a sense of complacency or false security. It can be helpful to talk to a counselor or priest/pastor about your feelings in order to gain a deeper understanding of yourself and to find a new path.

After that, I found out she had been cheating on me. I think about her all the time now, and we have been communicating on and off, but my friends/family don't know.
It sounds like you are still hung up on the breakup and the cheating.You need to focus on moving on.It is normal to feel hurt and upset after a breakup.The best way to process these feelings, is to talk to someone about them.Talking to someone who can listen without judging, can be really helpful in moving on.When you feel ready, you can tell your friends and family about your breakup and your new relationship.

I am an international student, and it is my first semester in graduate school in the United States. I faced a cultural shock, and I was so depressed when I arrived here. My counselor in the university was my savior. He helped me a great deal. Now I am going back to my country for a vacation.
It sounds like you are in a tough situation. Sending you away to your home country might not be the best thing for you right now. You should reach out to your university counselor to see if they can connect you with a therapist in your home country. If not, then consider looking for a therapist online or in your local community.
