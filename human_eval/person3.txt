I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out. How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it. I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy. What should I do?
Probably the most important thing is to be true to yourself and do what feels right for you. If you are attracted to women, that doesn't mean you have to be a lesbian or anything like that. Think about the best way to tell the girl you are interested in. I think it's best to be honest and if the girl is accepting and you both like each other, it can lead to a great relationship. Also, if you do decide to continue crossdressing, you may want to consider getting some counseling to work through any issues you may have with being a gay man in a woman's body. It's very common for gay men to feel like women, including wanting to be feminine. Maybe you can be a gay woman. :) Best of luck!

My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.  The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.
"Trust your instincts and trust your gut!I get the feeling you are doing a great job of watching out for his best interests by being honest with him about things.I can also tell that you are a very kind person who cares about your husband's happiness and well being.Sometimes, even when we are honest, the other person isn't able to handle the truth.I don't know if you could try being a little more tactful in confronting him about the missing beers.Maybe try saying something like ""I really feel like I'm supposed to be your partner in this marriage and I want to be, but I feel like we're not connecting and I want us to reconnect. I feel like we're not connecting. I want us to reconnect. Is there anything I can do for you to help us reconnect?""See how he responds.If he responds by getting defensive or starts to blame you for not ""understanding him,"" try saying something like ""I feel like we're both at fault. I feel like I've tried to connect with you, but I don't know if you feel like you can connect with me. I don't know if you feel like you can trust me.""If you're able to connect with him, listen to his feelings and validate them. If you're able to connect with him, you'll be able to know when you're both not connecting. If you're not able to connect, you'll both feel more comfortable talking about what's going on so you can figure out what's not working and make changes together."" If you're still feeling really uncomfortable after trying some of these suggestions, find a therapist to help you discuss things. A therapist can help you talk through your feelings and you can both look at ways to reconnect."Warmest wishes to you!""-Mark (www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com and www.LivingLovefully.com)"www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com"www.LivingLovefully.com"www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com"www.LivingLovefully.com"www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com"www.LivingLovefully.com"www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com"www.LivingLovefully.com"www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com"www.LivingLovefully.com"www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com"www.LivingLovefully.com"www.MarkMorrisLCSW.

I have been seeing this guy for a little over a year. Back in August, he asked for us to step back for now. Since then, he has still been in contact with me every day. We spent some time together over the holidays, but then I was gone for New Years with family. I came to find out that he put himself on a dating site. When I found out, I asked him about it, and he responded with this: “My apologies if I got my signals crossed, or if I wasn’t honest with you. You have helped me tons this past year and I am glad you are in my life. I didn’t realize you were still interested in dating. Again, my apologies.” Also, is it better to say that I want him in my life or that I want him as part of my life?
It's very common to have a conversation about what the relationship is right now. I would just say, 'I have been with you for a while, and I would like us to be together' or something to that effect. It depends on the level of emotional connection you have, but it's just a way of expressing that you want to be together.The question about what to say and what to ask, really just depends on your emotional level of connection with the other person. If you are still only in the beginning stages of getting to know each other, I would ask how you feel the other person wants you to express yourself. If you are unsure, maybe sending a handwritten note expressing yourself is better than what you wrote above.Good luck!

My spouse decided he no longer wanted me six years ago. Things have deteriorated so badly that we have separated but still live in the same house. He says he despises the sight of me, wants to be with other women, and divorce. What I don't understand is that he says constantly that I have no feelings for him and gets absurdly jealous if I speak to another male. Why does he constantly do these behaviors? I might add he has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and as a narcissist.
I'm so sorry to hear about what you are going through. I am not sure whether your husband has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder or not. If he has been diagnosed, then I would strongly encourage you to take his temperament assessment as well as the assessment for his narcissistic personality type. Once you have his diagnoses, then you can determine what therapy would be most helpful for him. I would also consider couples therapy so you and your husband can work together to repair your marriage. You both need to be willing to make changes and commit to the process of working on your marriage. I would also encourage you to learn about how to recognize emotional and verbal manipulation. It's extremely difficult to see our spouse making negative statements when they are hurtful and take them at face value. It's important to educate yourself on healthy and unhealthy ways of communicating with each other. You can find an excellent book that discusses this topic in detail, The Truth About Love by Dr. Sue Johnson. Then you can talk with your husband about his behaviors and ask him to do a self-assessment for emotional and verbal manipulation. Learning about emotional and verbal manipulation can help you be able to have clear conversations with each other. It will also help you be able to have a therapist guide you through the process. You and your husband need to work together to develop a plan for moving forward. I would suggest having a family therapy session with a therapist that specializes in couples and marriage. Then you can talk about your concerns and your plan for moving forward. I wish you the best!

Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.
I am glad that you are realizing that you are not crazy and that you are struggling with some anxiety. The good news is that you can work through this and it does not necessarily mean that you will be spending eternity in hell. Do you believe in an afterlife? If not, it may be because you have not had the experiences that some people have had who have had near death experiences. Near death experiences are personal accounts of people who have had experiences where they have come close to death and then have had a time when they have seen what is going on outside of their body (i.e. hell, heaven, other realms, etc.).The thing about hell is that the people who are in hell are the people who have chosen to live their lives in a way that does not support others and does not love themselves. There is a great quote that I like that says, If you are in hell, it is because you made your own peace.The good news is that there is an afterlife that people may enter into based on the experiences that they have had in life. This is not necessarily something that will happen to you, but there is a great chance that you will be able to choose where you go after you die. If you are interested in exploring near death experiences, there are many books and websites that can help you with that. Another good website is near-death.com. I hope that you are able to explore and find the answers that you are looking for. I would also encourage you to be kind to yourself and be gentle with yourself. Best of luck to you!

He's gone for 11 weeks for a band camp. It's week two right now. We used to be Intimate a lot, and now since he's busy 12 hours a day, we can't really be Intimate, even over the phone. Is it normal for me to more sensitive in general?
"It might be normal for you to feel more sensitive when your partner is out of the country, but it is certainly not normal to feel ""more sensitive in general."" If you feel that you are not getting enough intimacy with your partner while he's out of the country, it's important to have this conversation with him. When people feel that they aren't getting enough intimacy, they can sometimes think that they need to ""wait it out"" until their partner gets back. However, this is a very short-sighted approach. If you have difficulty being intimate with your partner while he is out of the country, and if you feel that this is impacting your relationship, you should have this conversation.The important thing is to be honest about what you are both feeling and thinking.""It sounds like you and your partner need to have this conversation to find out what you need from each other and how to get it.""I suggest finding a time when you are both calm and having a discussion that is not angry or frustrated. Also, try to find a time when you both have a few hours to spend together. If you are experiencing anxiety, I suggest seeing a professional therapist. It sounds that you are feeling a lot of pressure in this situation.""Best of luck!

"My wife and I have a great relationship except for our sex lives. We are pretty transparent and honest, and basically, she feels bad because she never wants to have sex. She doesn't have the desire. She's also never orgasmed. She feels like a terrible wife and fears I'll cheat on her. She doesn't know why. Last time we had sex, she cried and felt bad and didn't know why she cried. However, she also told me that the last time we had sex, she felt me in her, but it just felt ""ehh"" and wanted to stop. That makes me feel really awful. We rarely have foreplay. Everything I try tickles her, so she makes me stop. We are both frustrated but very much in love. She and I are in our early 20s. We’re married and we have a baby on the way."
Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you and your wife are having problems in the bedroom. I would say that the problem is not one person and the problem is not one sex life, it's two people and their sex lives. To have a healthy sex life, you need to both be on the same page. Have you discussed your concerns about her lack of desire with her? If not, maybe you should consider doing so. While she might be feeling guilty that she's making you feel awful, the solution is not to let her get away with it. You need to communicate in an assertive way, but in a way that does not come across as mean or angry. You need to tell her that you're frustrated and want to figure out what to do. Without raising your voice or getting upset, you need to tell her that you feel like she's pushing you away and that she doesn't seem like she wants to be intimate with you. In that same message, you need to ask her how she's feeling and let her know that you want to know what she's thinking and how she's doing. Ask her to open up and be vulnerable with you. If she is not willing to do that, she will close up, and you may never get an answer. I would recommend that you also see a counsellor to learn some assertive skills that you can use when talking to your wife about her lack of desire. Best of luck!

I don't have time to live or take care of myself at times. It's causing depression, stress, and anxiety. I don't know what to do.
Take time to get and stay healthy. Your physical body is the house your mind and spirit live in. If you don't take care of your body, your spirit will not have a place to go. I see this all the time. People are so busy, they don't take time to tend to their spirit. We need to recharge and that can't be done when we are exhausted and stressed. Be sure to take time to rest, sleep, exercise and eat well. Redirect your energy and find some activities that make you feel good about yourself. And most of all, ask yourself what is it you are trying to accomplish. If the answer is not clear cut, try to refocus. It is not easy to say goodbye to things that are taking you where you want to be, but if you want to change, you will have to change. How do you want your life to be? What do you need to do to get there? Start small and put yourself on a path that you can achieve. You can do it!

I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately. I was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Lately, I've been questioning everything from my career to my relationship. My boyfriend and I just moved in a few months ago. All of a sudden, I don't feel as comfortable around him as I used to, although I can't seem to find a reason as to why I feel this way.
"Hello. I am very sorry to hear of your struggle. One of the first things I would like to tell you is that there is help. I have counseled many individuals who have anxiety and panic attacks. This article by Psych Central is a great resource: http://www.psychcentral.com/lib/ways-to-handle-anxiety-in-humans/ One of the most common and effective ways to decrease anxiety is to do cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with a professional counselor. You can also do CBT alone by utilizing the techniques taught in the Cognitive Behavioral Workbook Series. Another method for decreasing anxiety is through the use of self-help books. I would recommend the books listed here: http://www.therapy4selfhelp.com/self-help-books-anxiety.htmlAs for your relationship, it sounds as if you may be in a rut. If you are not being fulfilled in your relationship, you may want to consider seeing a relationship therapist to see if there are ways to increase the intimacy and intimacy-related behaviors between you. You may also want to consider seeing a therapist to address your career and relationship. A therapist may be able to assess your level of happiness and what areas of your life you may want to change. It is important to be honest with yourself and question the reasons behind your discomfort and what may be causing it. If you are having panic attacks while driving or at work, I would recommend calling 911 and receiving immediate medical care. The anxiety and panic attacks you are experiencing may be signs of a medical condition. I would recommend going to see a doctor. Another method for decreasing anxiety is through medication. If anxiety medication is a necessity for you, you may want to consider a psychiatrist who specializes in working with individuals who suffer from anxiety.I hope this was helpful. Please remember that there is help and you are not alone. Best of luck to you! Laura"My boyfriend and I recently moved in together.

I had to go to the emergency room today to get an X-ray of my spine. My boyfriend didn't want to sit there and wait with me. Instead, he wanted to go do things for his friends while I waited. When I was done, he was twenty minutes late in picking me up. He doesn't understand why I'm mad, and we keep bickering at each other over the smallest things. He thinks I don't have a reason to be mad, but I believe that I do.

A good relationship depends on how the people define their relationships.There are people who consider it normal to talk to their partners in a way that is disrespectful.Also, there are people who consider it normal to do whatever they want without consulting with or telling their partners.In each of these situations, the lack of respect hurts the relationship because the partners don't feel appreciated.How do the partners define their relationship? This is the key question. If one partner doesn't respect the other then the relationship is damaged.Does the relationship need more respect? Maybe. Does the person who is not respected feel accepted by the partner? Maybe. Does the partner who is not respected feel respected by the partner? Maybe.In any relationship the key is to understand what the partner needs and wants.This doesn't mean that a person is not allowed to have their own opinion. It means that an opinion can be respected and listened to, or it can be ignored.There are plenty of people who are willing to listen to their partners and then do what they want anyway. It is this attitude of ""do what I want and worry about how you feel"" that can lead to relationships that feel somewhat disrespected.If you are satisfied with the way your boyfriend treats you, then continue to be satisfied with the way he treats you.If you feel there is room for improvement, then concentrate on improving yourself and ask your boyfriend to concentrate on improving himself.The results will be better relationships overall.

I feel like I have to be promiscuous in order to keep people around? It started after I got raped by my ex-boyfriend.
Your answer is a good one.Your answer is that the way to handle your need for the presence and affection of others, is to accept the need.Relationships require effort from both people. If you become used to having others around, then when they leave, you may feel empty.Instead of becoming promiscuous, consider becoming satisfied by getting to know the people you do have relationships with.Whether you are with a boyfriend or girlfriend, consider talking with them about your life, and whether you would like to spend time together.Exercising the effort to be in relationship with others, may help you to be satisfied with your relationships.Good luck in your relationships!

I got sick really bad and was throwing up for three days and nights. I thought I was going to die. Then about a week later, I started having this desire to be female. I never had this desire before. All I can think about is being a woman. I don't get pleasure from my penis anymore either. Women are attractive, but not like before. I can also find men attractive now. I'm too ashamed to tell anyone.
"I'd be interested in what you associate with being female. You say ""I want to be a woman"". That sounds more like you want to live as a woman than that you feel you are one already.In the past, you may have heard the word ""transsexual"" and assumed it was the same as what you're saying. It isn't. A transsexual person is a person who feels they were born into the wrong body and want to change it. You may want to be a woman but that doesn't mean that you want to change your body. You may want to live as a woman, but that doesn't mean you would want to change your body.If you really are considering changing your body, I would recommend seeing a therapist first. I don't know what you're thinking, but telling your doctor about wanting to be female may not be the best idea. In the meantime, if you feel like you're starting to live in a way that reflects this desire, that's ok. Keep doing what you're doing. Feeling is ok. Just don't expect the world to change just because you want it to. I'm curious about what you're ashamed of. In your question, you say that you're ashamed to tell anyone. But I don't see it there. You're telling me something about being embarrassed about something that you're feeling. As you're working through this, you may start to feel differently about what you're ashamed of. Again, as you're living this life, you may start to feel differently.But the more important question is what do you associate with being male?

I have no friends, no hobbies, and no interest in anything. I get annoyed with everything and everyone. I am always tired, i can sleep 8 hrs or 12 hrs and im still tired. I don't know what to do. Is this normal?
"Hello, and thank you for your question. First, I want to say that if you are only reading through the first couple of responses, I commend you for being honest about your feelings and for asking for some feedback. It is very rare to see this type of honesty. As for your question, I believe that you may have some depression or a more serious mood disorder. I can tell this from your description of what you are experiencing, but it would be difficult to diagnose you from that description. It sounds like your symptoms are interfering with your daily life in a negative way. It sounds like you are very unhappy and would like some help. In my professional opinion, I would recommend you see a medical doctor to rule out a medical cause for your symptoms. If you are diagnosed with depression, a prescription for an antidepressant will likely help you feel better and get your life back on track. It sounds like you are trying to figure out what to do. In addition, there are many organizations and websites that offer free counseling. I recommend that you look into getting some counseling. Counseling may not fix your problem, but it will likely help you cope with your problem. There are many different types of counselors, and there are many different types of counseling. Some counselors may be better suited for a specific type of problem. If you can get counseling from a therapist who specializes in depression, I think that would be a good idea. If you are unable to get counseling, I would recommend trying to find some friends who you can talk to about your feelings. Maybe that is something that you can do over lunch or at a work event?

I feel like I hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes. How can I start accepting myself and be more confident?
"To start being confident, you need to first be comfortable with who you are. To do this you need to not compare yourself to other people. One way to be more confident is to join a group or class. That way you can meet others with similar interest and work toward the same goal. Another way is to find a therapy that caters to your needs. A therapist can help you explore why you feel you hate yourself and develop skills to cope."If you are a man, you may want to ask your family for feedback. Women tend to be more aware of their own self worth than men. "Good luck!"Cindy"WTF is confidence, and how do I get it?

How can I learn to be content and at peace with myself regardless of my career, relationship status, etc?

You can create your own peace and contentment by trusting your inner wisdom and knowing that you are perfect exactly as you are. The key is to go within and start working on yourself with your own therapist.

My daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of 10. She then started to act younger than she is. Now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesn't act her age. I don't know why this is happening. Is this normal?
"While I agree that ""normal"" is a slippery term, I do see that you are very concerned about your daughter's behavior. While there is no absolute answer as to why a child would suddenly behave a certain way (even if it is for a brief time), it is helpful to try to gather as much information as possible about the child and their situation to try and understand what might be going on. One thing to consider is that many children who are in the 9-10 year old range are still being evaluated and treated as younger children. Children in this age range may seem ""normal"", but they are probably not. Some of the behaviors that I see can be as simple as a child wanting to play with other children or wanting to play a certain kind of game that they did not play as a child. But, there could be a lot more to it. A child may feel more comfortable with other children their own age. Younger children may have more energy and may want to spend more time with adults who are still in a very energy-intensive phase of their life. So, if we look at the situation from this perspective, I would consider talking with your daughter about what she is interested in and see if she would be willing to spend more time with you and her siblings to see what is going on. I would also ask her what she is doing when she is not with you, her siblings, and the other children who she likes to play with. If she is spending more time with younger children, I would see if she could see the other children that she likes to play with. This could be a short-term or a long-term situation. I would also consider talking with a mental health provider to see if they could help you see what is going on. If your daughter is younger than 10 and is interested in an older child, I would encourage you to try and find out what it is that they are interested in. If they are interested in an older sibling, I would encourage you to ask the older sibling to spend more time with the younger one. With more time spent together, it is more likely that the younger child will have a more positive relationship with the older child. I hope this helps and best of luck!

How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?
"I've been in therapy for almost three years now and I just had my first termination session. I'm a 21-year-old college student and I was really happy to see that my counselor has a ""termination session"" in his calendar. It was something I was really curious about, but I didn't want to ask, because I thought it might be uncomfortable. Well, in the end, it was actually one of the best experiences I've had in therapy.It was so simple, really.

I'm in my late 50s. I never loved or have been loved. I need deeper help than is offered in my small town, but I cannot leave this town because of agoraphobia. I find myself losing hope more and more. My brain barely works anymore, and my memory so small, I forget in a moment. I serve no purpose. I'm incapable of work or anything of value, and I never have been. I’m a complete waste of time and resources, and yet I keep trying. Why? Why does God insist that I continue to exist? I’m not suicidal, just tired.

I am a teenager. I have been experiencing major episodes of depression (if that's even what it is) for several years. It’s always getting worse. I have been having panic attacks, feeling like I can't control my fears, and I can't even bring myself to care if I live or die anymore. The problem is that I don't know who to ask for help. When I try to talk to my parents, I freeze completely and can't do anything but make a joke because never once in my life have we talked about our feelings.
A lot of people tend to avoid discussing their feelings with their parents because they feel like they may not be heard or they may not be able to fully understand what the teen is experiencing.

For the past four weeks, I've been having nightmares and hearing voices telling me of horrible things. They're not random voices, but rather, the voices of those I care about.
"Hello, and thank you for your question. I am always interested in learning more about how people are managing their symptoms, as well as other aspects of their lives.The short answer is that a lot of people have different reactions to experiencing symptoms of a condition like PTSD. It can be difficult to tell if you are having a recurrence of symptoms, or if the symptoms are a result of the experiences that led to your symptoms. If you are hearing voices in your nightmares, this may be related to the trauma. However, hearing voices in the day-to-day life of your waking experience may also be related to your trauma. So, it is very important to talk to someone about your experiences if you are having these symptoms. I also want to make clear that it can be difficult to distinguish between symptoms related to PTSD and other conditions. It is common for people to experience anxiety and/or panic attacks after experiencing a trauma. In some cases, these symptoms can be quite traumatic for people. So, it is important that people talk to someone about the symptoms if they are experiencing them. There are also many people who do not experience PTSD symptoms and still have a lot of trauma related experiences. One of the things that is really helpful for some people is mindfulness practices. Mindfulness is a way of being in the present moment and being aware of your thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations. Mindfulness is a practice that many people use to help them manage their symptoms. While mindfulness can be helpful, it should not be considered a cure for trauma. If you are interested in learning more about mindfulness, it would be helpful to find an experienced therapist. Also, it is important that you always talk to your primary care provider or doctor if you are experiencing any type of health related symptom, including anxiety and panic attacks. I hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J.

I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out. How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it. I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy. What should I do?
Hi, I'm sorry to hear about your situation. I'm so sorry to hear about your feelings about crossdressing and how you feel about the way people treat you. Crossdressing can be very distressing and can be very triggering for some people. I would encourage you to talk with a therapist or two about what's going on and what you can do to make it easier for you to feel comfortable and feel loved. I know there are lots of resources out there for people who are struggling with this and I encourage you to seek them out. I hope this helps!

My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.  The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.

I have been seeing this guy for a little over a year. Back in August, he asked for us to step back for now. Since then, he has still been in contact with me every day. We spent some time together over the holidays, but then I was gone for New Years with family. I came to find out that he put himself on a dating site. When I found out, I asked him about it, and he responded with this: “My apologies if I got my signals crossed, or if I wasn’t honest with you. You have helped me tons this past year and I am glad you are in my life. I didn’t realize you were still interested in dating. Again, my apologies.” Also, is it better to say that I want him in my life or that I want him as part of my life?

My spouse decided he no longer wanted me six years ago. Things have deteriorated so badly that we have separated but still live in the same house. He says he despises the sight of me, wants to be with other women, and divorce.

Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.
"I think it's more likely that you're experiencing a combination of depression and anxiety. You're probably feeling a combination of depression and anxiety.

"My wife and I have a great relationship except for our sex lives. We are pretty transparent and honest, and basically, she feels bad because she never wants to have sex. She doesn't have the desire. She's also never orgasmed. She feels like a terrible wife and fears I'll cheat on her. She doesn't know why. Last time we had sex, she cried and felt bad and didn't know why she cried. However, she also told me that the last time we had sex, she felt me in her, but it just felt ""ehh"" and wanted to stop. That makes me feel really awful. We rarely have foreplay. Everything I try tickles her, so she makes me stop. We are both frustrated but very much in love. She and I are in our early 20s. We’re married and we have a baby on the way."

i'm being verbally abused on a daily basis by my parents in front of my child. i feel like i’m trapped and i have no escape. i feel like i have to listen to the horrible things they say and just take all of it. i need some way of learning how to cope with listening to it especially since i have nowhere else to go. i feel very emotionally drained how can i deal with this?
"i cant imagine what you are feeling but i can tell you that you are right to be concerned about your children baring witness to this abuse. this is a great teachable moment for your kids. how you handle yourself will be very important for your children to see. your ""reaction"" is what you should focus on. will you react with rage and name calling?

"hello, and thank you for your question. messengers are machines, and sometimes they even encrypt our communications so that we cannot receive the full impact of what others say.i would recommend working through these difficult but necessary communication points with a mental health professional to come up with a course of action, such as setting confidentiality agreements, keeping it private, being specific about your problem(s), and making sure you have clear expectations of how others will respond to you.if you have not already, please consider speaking with your doctor about it. a psychiatrist could advise you of how you can sign up and press that requires a bit of opening up and asking for help, which you need to avoid.i also recommend that you try and get help from a mental health professional. the answer is simple: have empathy, if people don't respond back, if not, that is the best.

my dad passed away when i was a teenager. i never got any help, and five years later, i feel like i can't handle it anymore.
"i understand that this is very hard to handle, but i imagine that's the effect you were to receive, especially as you start to understand your missing father. it  ⁇ s very normal to look for guidance about who to ask for help, and to seek out support when you can. (at least, that's what i've noticed with other people who've experienced this, i'm reminded of this every time i think about it). if you are feeling emotionally upset or sad, it may be helpful to consider bringing your deceased father into a way that you (lilment and understanding) into perspective and to understand how you are feeling. i know you may be focusing on ""who i am"", but often the way it is conveyed, is not really what motivated him to grieving.

i have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.
"something to remember about anxiety is that its a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action. some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. the first i'd recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes.
=== 67 ===
is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?
"yes, it is normal to cry during therapy, it is a time of catharsis, letting things out, shedding our skin, dropping our weights and just to let you know, even therapists sometimes feel like crying in sessions. although people often cry or become upset, it is in no way a measure of ""good therapy"". c"s come in many forms, and there is no measurement that we can use to measure emotions. although people are people, and crying is a form of cathars tears, no guarantees, just a measure to make sure you are 100% sure your ""complain,"" also very likely carries some measure of tissues and other things. not all of usday thing we need to cry.

on the first day of school i wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like i had bigger boobs. i did that the whole school year and my parents never found out. but now i can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest. how do i fix this?
"if youre sure youre a good student and havent got a diagnosis from any family in your court, talk to a local therapist about whether you have reasonable expectations of yourself of how others will view you.you say you went to bra "empathetically" because people are often anxious to be accepted for who you are. i get that this can be a challenge for some people especially when they are just starting out. i have had many people try to pressure you into having ideal body image, but in your situation it seems that your body is the only thing measuring is, ""goe..."" to be more specific and give you feedback. you said you went to bra ""sexpetric"". it's a good sign that you are doing something right.

"it would be my professional opinion that the desire for you to keep it a secret at all, while yes i could see it as ""giving you a chance with a girl,"" is something that might be more about a discomfort for you. if you are comfortable with your kinks and fetishes (if i may call it such, not my intention to pathologize in any way though), then be as open as you want to be. but i also dont know that you need to be announcing it as part of your online dating profile (because you do say it ""bothers girls i ask out"" which to me implies that that is what you're leading with.) my hope is that people dont make dating decisions based on your kinky behaviors, but more likely that they would make decisions based on your own comfort and security with said kinky behaviors."" this carries with you being hesitant of trying to ""exposure"" but if you decide to go the whole situation, then i would not be surprised that dating is a problem and would advise that you choose a counselor or a if you should decide that is a good idea for you.if not a single person keeps a happy person, regardless of the reasons why you do.

"hi texas, thanks for your question. there is no indication that he is ""no longer a good husband""...you know, unless he says something about being ""apart from the bed"".. you don't mention whether he has a bottle lying around or not.. if he has a reason to be so careless, that would be a problem.. you don't mention whether he wants to change in the long term, because they're already doing so through.. i wonder, around what he would it means that you expect from him to change, and if he hasnesity, he could have a different discussion that would likely have had the conversations that matter. if he hasn't changed, that conversation would be in that conversation, and he would probably expect you to change how you feel about him.. i offer an observation to you:a 30 second to consider what might happen in the situation.. we certainly don't like to read, but we definitely know that there are definitely wrong or wrong answers. i know this may worry you the time you respond, the time is why you're saying you'"" and then promptly changing your ""30 days and limiting alcohol" and becoming more aware of the details or even identifying details that are uncomfortable and uncomfortable but that just makes your own security. if you really feel like doing something, you can count to be more mindful about what you're going to be more mindful about what you're feeling.

"hello, and thank you for your question. dating is something that we do alot, but sometimes our own motivations can differ. there are usually several levels of trust (comparison, comparison, endorsement, etc). it’s likely that you have already internalized your desire to be with this guy by understanding that it is more than simply being together. it sounds like you may be trying to figure out what you want, but i wonder if there are some ways to communicate these desires.

my friend is abusing her prescription medicine. even though she told me she didn't have any more pills, i found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications.
"it is very possible that there is an unspected breach of contract between the two of you. this is happening for a variety of reasons. the most important one being clear senth, is that this is a "relapse.") if this is a traumatic experience for you then this should put you in even greater fear. if the withdrawal occurs before you take action, you may be required by law to tell your medical professional.

sometimes i cant stop thinking about life after death. i was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  when i think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), i feel overwhelmed. i don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. sometimes i just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  am i crazy? i dont think these thoughts are normal.
"hi california, what youre experiencing is indeed anxiety; it's very common. through research we know a lot of things about how to reduce anxiety. i'll get you started and it's a great idea to connect with a therapist who can build on these ideas and get to know you well.it's natural to have random thoughts that unsettle us. our brains are complex, wonderful things. fearful and anxious thoughts are a part of this picture; their purpose is to prepare us for the future and to help us make sense of the past and learn from it.

hes gone for 11 weeks for a band camp. it's week two right now. we used to be intimate a lot, and now since he's busy 12 hours a day, we cant really be intimate, even over the phone. is it normal for me to more sensitive in general?
"hello, and let me say first things that have to be said, before hand, ""not at the top!"" ""allergy"" is a general term for ""sensation"" these are things that you naturally would describe as ""odd"" to you, and certainly more specific to you. i would talk with you about sensitivities and explore ways to live these feelings to the fullest, and if you can give something to either of you that you may find easier to accept, ""more of the time we have with each other, and we all have moments when we are interrupted, like when we are interrupted, like when we are interrupted, like at a restaurant, or when we are in a group. if you can just say, ""happiness"" over the phone and ask him what he would like from you, and to him what you would like him to. and remember, just because a conversation or conversation can lead to more sensitivity in general, which he would be most interesting for you to experience with your own emotions.

"my wife and i have a great relationship except for our sex lives. we are pretty transparent and honest, and basically, she feels bad because she never wants to have sex. she doesnt have the desire. she's also never orgasmed. she feels like a terrible wife and fears i'll cheat on her. she doesn't know why. last time we had sex, she cried and felt bad and didnt know why she cried. however, she also told me that the last time we had sex, she felt me in her, but it just felt ""ehh"" and wanted to stop. that makes me feel really awful. we rarely have foreplay. everything i try tickles her, so she makes me stop. we are both frustrated but very much in love. she and i are in our early 20s. we’re married and we have a baby on the way."
"hi, newark. it sounds to me like your wife has experienced a period of time where she was not happy and that she wants to work it out. i can tell you that this is frustrating and wears you down, but the important thing to remember is that you can make it work. if you are advocating for your wife, i would encourage her to seek help from a therapist who understands sexuality and relationship and relationship history. i would encourage her to seek help immediately if she starts to show you a problem.

i dont have time to live or take care of myself at times. it's causing depression, stress, and anxiety. i dont know what to do.
"the answer is quite simple - take care of yourself, get regular sleep, spend time with friends/family, etc. whatever words you choose to use, take care of yourself. often times people struggle with more than one or two words and have more than one way they think to function/deal with their anxiety/depression. if you are seeking to maintain a sense of balance in your life, balance would mean making time for other things, i would encourage you to find a therapist/therapist who specializes in tv living positively. this will help you recognize when you feel more than you are able to manage your anxiety/depression/depression which will show in your mind:experie you have the answers you need, then youve found the --dr of meaning ""emptiness and depression"" that is rooted from all around you.

i like getting attention from men. i don't have sex. i lead them on to thinking i might want to. i like to tease, i like for men to chase me, and i like to feel wanted.
"i imagine that this is a pretty common question.one question is how to be confident that you can be someone a certain way. are you trying to do too much, or just not feel like doing anything?if you're being self-critical, then doing exactly what you need to be doing, is what will help you feel satisfied.to address this concern, id recommend possibly talking with a therapist. this will help you explore what is intentional (or not), what will give you satisfaction (maybe even making a point to your sex). to do this, i suggest having a therapist help you as you develop yourself to feel satisfied, and to developing your own sense of self-esteem. this will help you become emotionally healthy and develop a sense of security based upon what you will become.if you are asexual (and you dont like being chasing yourself), then maybe you need more information than just ""try on""".this is not an exclusive topic but there are great ideas out there to help you with this.if you find any reason not,then you can discuss this with a therapist to not just start answering your question in more detail, but rather that you avoid engaging in a sexual with a competent therapist.the conversations that come up with many questions.the more information you can focus on the intense sexual activity, the greater the risk.i hope that this is helpful to you and that this is something that you can focus on developing confidence in yourself.""

there are issues from my past that have me very heavily burdened in my heart. ive been torn for so many years and i need help so i can move on with my life. i experienced trauma when i was 8 years old and i did come out about it until i was 40. now i know this is what's holding me back on my happiness. i've met a very loving and caring man but because im holding on to these things from my past i’m pushing him away. how can i get my life back?
"hi cross country closeness, i have several good points. i am sorry that this has been so up close and personal. you have made a big mistake that you can't escape it. break the habit, i would recommend seeing a ""psychiatr"" like ""medicine"" . a medical professional can help you to get over the ""currrrr"" label.

ive been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately. i was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessive-compulsive disorder. lately, i've been questioning everything from my career to my relationship. my boyfriend and i just moved in a few months ago. all of a sudden, i don't feel as comfortable around him as i used to, although i cant seem to find a reason as to why i feel this way.
"how is your boyfriend responding to your discomfort around him?has he told you that hes noticed changes in you?the good news about a relationship is that you can talk about matters with the other person. doing so can only help clarify feelings and what either of you expect from the relationship. given that the two of you recently moved in together, it is natural for new dynamics, feelings and expectations to arise. it just adds to the reasonableness of talking with each other about how living together feels to each of you.psychiatrists earn their living by diagnosing people and telling them to take pills. very often, just being told the person has a ""condition"" makes them feel fragile and less capable than they actually are.anxiety and panic attacks do mean that there is a great deal of emotion and situation needing to be addressed.it is the normal sign of having to address many or deep matters.

i have family issues, and my dad was both violent and a cheater.
"hi new york, theres no way to keep your past from affecting your present and future, because it's a huge part of who we are. the good news is, though, that the effect doesn't have to be negative. i'm met many people who have horrific pasts and it helps them know confidently, every day, what kind of person they want to be and what kind of world they want to live in, and it helps them make really great decisions. you can accept your past, integrate your traumas and move forward in a very different way. if you see negative ways in which your past affects you (and this is also common), you are wise to seek professional help.

i have a friend that who i used to be in a relationship with. it was brief and turned into us being just good friends. i spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. was i wrong?
"the most important thing to ask yourself here is, ""how did this action affect my relationship, and is it worth the consequences?"" regardless of your intentions in this action, your boyfriend is uncomfortable with this type of behavior. from here, we can objectively decide if spending time with your previous partner (because that is likely what your boyfriend sees them as) is worth harming the relationship you currently have. it is very rare that a person would be comfortable with their partner spending more than a very little amount of time with their exes. many times, it just gives the wrong impressions.

i had to go to the emergency room today to get an x-ray of my spine. my boyfriend didnt want to sit there and wait with me. instead, he wanted to go do things for his friends while i waited. when i was done, he was twenty minutes late in picking me up. he doesn't understand why i'm mad, and we keep bickering at each other over the smallest things. he thinks i dont have a reason to be mad, but i believe that i do.
"hi, first things first, i want to say that you're brave to taking this on board. it sounds like you've got a big difference to make and a lot of times these differences are for good reason. your boyfriend (unless you consider the latter) doesn't understand why he keeps waiting for you to show up. you don't need to wait for him to make a decision. if you don't think he's going to make the decision for you, then ask him.

i feel like i have to be promiscuous in order to keep people around? it started after i got raped by my ex-boyfriend.
"hi, yes we could get [youre] arrested]... but not so with our partners. yes, we would get arrested for trying to sabotage a plan to rap them. what we have to work on is what we can live with... i would get things ready, i will work hard, i will create ""safe havend moments"", or ""what we imagine is going to be the most exciting part of your relationship."" i would work to create ""safe moments."" i am a firm believer.

i got sick really bad and was throwing up for three days and nights. i thought i was going to die. then about a week later, i started having this desire to be female. i never had this desire before. all i can think about is being a woman. i dont get pleasure from my penis anymore either. women are attractive, but not like before. i can also find men attractive now. im too ashamed to tell anyone.
"i get the sense that, aside from penises, your body part in which penith is most likely - is some form of ""pre-emo"". have you tried before tasting peni (or wine)? have you tried mixing wine and cream? or two glasses of wine? many cultures use the same method to make wine.

every time my partner gets angry for anything, she takes it out on me. nothing i do is right, and once she's mad, she calls me all kinds of names and is verbally abusive. she says it isn’t abuse, it’s just angry verbal bashing, and that it’s different. it gets worse each time. the names are very vulgar now.
"hi biddeford,this is a great analogy you could try with your therapist:-) talk to your cbt cbt therapist and mention this in your question. not cbt, because its how the therapist will help you through the emotionally painful parts of being in a partnership. you can use this time to teach her the value of being heard and valued as a partner, rather than a ""security concern. ""what is the authority or regulatory framework in a state that is not affected by this relationship? this is the simplest way to stop this cycle of emotional connection between the partner and your partner.

is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?
"yes, it is normal to cry during therapy, it is a time of catharsis, letting things out, shedding our skin, dropping our weights and just to let you know, even therapists sometimes feel like crying in sessions. although people often cry or become upset, it is in no way a measure of ""good therapy"". c"s come in many forms, and there is no measurement that we can use to measure emotions. although people are people, and crying is a form of cathars tears, no guarantees, just a measure to make sure you are 100% sure your ""complain,"" also very likely carries some measure of tissues and other things. not all of usday thing we need to cry.
