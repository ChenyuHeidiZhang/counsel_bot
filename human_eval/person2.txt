"My wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that I'm doing things she finds disrespectful even when I don't mean it like that. For example, she gets offended when I call someone at work ""sweetheart."" I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her. She doesn't, and never will say she was wrong. How do I get her to understand?"
"For many people, a discussion about sensitive topics can make the atmosphere feel more tense and emotional. The best way I've found to reduce the intensity of this type of discussion is to have it when you both are feeling calm. I suggest having a discussion when you're both not angry but also not feeling neutral. If you're feeling frustrated, then you're likely to be more emotional and reactive. You can have these discussions when both of you are at work or out with your families. It's best to have the discussion when you have a calm time where you can just focus on what you want to discuss. Going to a counselor will allow you to have the discussion with a neutral person who can help you identify your needs and her needs. You can help her understand your experience and she can explain hers. This will help you understand each other better and minimize the risk of the discussion escalating."I hope this helps. :-)"Carmen Rodriguez, LMHCP, LMCC"I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her."I don't, and never will say she was wrong."How do I get her to understand?

When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much. I’m afraid it’s going to break her. I don't know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.
I'm sorry that you are going through this. You may be right, it is not normal for your daughter to be stressing out so much. I think the best thing you can do is to sit down with your daughter and let her know that you see that she is stressed out and you want to help her. You can tell her that you believe she is working really hard and that it is not normal for her to be stressing out like this. Then you can offer to do things for her to help her. I would recommend that you get in contact with a counselor or therapist that can help both of you. This is not something that you can do on your own. If your daughter is not comfortable with you contacting a counselor, that is ok. You can either try to find a counselor that you can talk to, or you can find a therapist on the phone and try them out for a week or two. If you don't like it, try someone else. If your daughter does not want to talk to you or is not comfortable with you trying to help her, you can always try to find a counselor that can help her. They may be able to do things that you can't do or won't do. I hope this helps. Please remember that you can always come to me with your concerns. I would love to help you and your daughter.Warm regards,Laura Spencer, LMSW~ therapist and author~www.LSWLC.com~www.LivingSelfHealing.com~www.LivingWellGutsy.com~www.LivingWellMama.com~www.LivingWellWoman.com~www.LivingWellSelf.com~www.LivingWellSelfHealing.com~www.LivingWellSelfCoaching.com~www.LivingWellSelfHealing.org~www.LivingWellSelfCoaching.org~www.LivingWellSelfWellness.org~www.LivingWellHome.org~www.LivingWellWellness.org~www.LivingWellWellBeing.org~www.LivingWellRelationships.org~www.LivingWellSelfCoaching.org~www.LivingWellSelfHealing.org~www.LivingWellRelationships.org~www.LivingWellSelfCoaching.org~www.LivingWellSelfHealing.org~www.LivingWellSelfBeing.org~www.LivingWellSelfBeingWell.org~www.LivingWellSelfBeingWell.

My fiancé of 15 years is always helping out his family, and I feel like his family takes advantage of his kindness. We're about to get married this Saturday, but I feel like he is always gonna put them first instead of myself and our three kids. I am not enjoying our engagement at all.
One thing that I wonder is if you are having difficulty with communicating in the relationship.One of the main tasks in therapy is to be able to discuss different topics and feelings. As part of this, the therapist will ask questions to help you and your partner open up to one another. In the process of doing this, you will learn more about each other and you may learn new information about yourself that will change how you feel about the relationship.I hope this helps. I wish you the best in your wedding!

I am going through a divorce. He is extremely angry. He refuses to physically assist me with our teenager daughter. I have no extended family support. Often times, I feel overwhelmed, tired, and joyless. I feel out of control, sad and depressed on a daily basis. I am just going through the motions of life every day. I am in my mid-50s. I have almost 29 years on my job. How can I handle this?
The relationship you have with your ex is the source of your depression and sense of out of control feelings.Your partner’s unwillingness to assist you with your daughter is a reflection of the person he is.This doesn’t mean the fault is with you or your daughter.Divorce affects all the parties.Especially if there was an abusive relationship, it takes time and energy to process and heal from the relationship.Its normal to feel depressed and sad after such a significant break up.Try to see your relationship as a learning experience. The lesson is that this relationship is over. And you are the one to decide when you are ready for a new relationship. And you are the one who will make this decision by living the life you want to live. This may be time to do things on your own or with the help of a trusted friend or neighbor.Also, re-evaluate your own sense of self-worth. Are you doing the best job you can?

I empathize so much, even with characters on tv or in video games, that I actually feel physical pain. This has made life difficult to say the least. I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder. But since it's such a new disorder I can't find any information about it. Could this be what is going on with me?
Yes, empathy is a wonderful trait to have.

In order to visit your doctor you will need to show a photo ID and have it in your possession.

We weren't long distance until he joined the military. I love him and I know he loves, me but it's complicated. He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid. How do I keep our relationship going?
This is a great question. It sounds like you are both wanting a long-distance relationship and are very concerned that he may find someone else. You could both just continue to be honest with each other about your feelings. Each of you could write out what you want from the relationship and then discuss it as a family. Maybe you could start off by sharing with each other what you want and then discuss how that is possible within the military rules. You could also share with him what your fears are and ask him if he could try to reassure you that he is not going to leave. This can be a regular conversation. You could also consider asking him to write a letter to you while he is away. You could share it with your family or have it sent to you. I am sure that he would appreciate the reassurance that you are thinking about him. Good luck!

My doctor seems to think I am in danger of having one. I neglected to ask how this was different than an episode. I have been formally diagnosed with bipolar type 1.
"Hi, I'm sorry to hear about your family members' difficulties. Bipolar disorder is a serious illness that affects the whole family. You can help the rest of the family by recognizing that these people are struggling, and not blaming them for it. I've seen this kind of thing happen with family members who aren't aware that bipolar disorder is a physical illness. They ""catch"" it because someone else is getting sick, or they're drinking too much, or they've been away from their support system too long. Bipolar disorder is treatable, and once you've been diagnosed and treated, you will be able to live a normal life and do the things that are important to you. If your family members are having difficulties, make sure they are getting the proper care and treatment. If they are getting treatment, it's a good idea for you to be a part of it, because it's likely that they will need support and encouragement. This is your family members' health, too, and it's important that they get the care that they need. Best wishes for your family's health. Robin J.

"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?  How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?"
This is a really important question. The thing is, every therapist is different. Some therapists are better at working with issues that you may have and some are better at working with issues that your friends may have. But, the good thing is that you can learn to talk to your therapist about what you need. Your therapist is there to support you throughout your whole journey and they can help you figure out how to get the most out of your sessions. If you feel like you are getting the most out of your sessions but your therapist is not helping you out figure out what you need, you may want to find a therapist who can help you get the most out of your sessions.To give you a general idea of how to find the right therapist:1. If you are looking for a therapist that works in a particular area that you have an issue, you can Google them. (Don't forget to read their website!

My boyfriend of five years told me he cheated on me during our relationship after we broke up. We've since gotten back together and are trying to make it work. I don't know how to trust him now, but I really want to make it work, and it seems like he does too. But my trust issues are getting in the way and causing problems.
Thank you for sharing.

My son stole my debit card and lied about it. It's not the first time he has lied. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I should punish him or make him do something. I've tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong. I have grounded him, but nothing works. What should I do?
Your son sounds like a very challenging child.I have heard of family counseling being beneficial.Has your son told you his reasons for lying?Is he blaming others or is he pointing fingers at himself?It sounds like he may have some self-blame. Is there someone whom you can talk to about this?The most important question is whether there is any improvement in his behavior.If he continues to lie and is blaming others, then it sounds like he needs some more intensive therapeutic help.Lying and blaming others is an indication of a more general problem with self-esteem.He may very well be a wonderful person.This behavior is not who he is.Maybe he feels that he has to live up to some standard that he doesn't feel worthy of.If he can find someone who understands him to talk to and if he can find a therapist who can help him improve his self-esteem and sense of worth, then he may be able to make great progress.Good luck!

I'm being verbally abused on a daily basis by my parents in front of my child. I feel like I’m trapped and I have no escape. I feel like I have to listen to the horrible things they say and just take all of it. I need some way of learning how to cope with listening to it especially since I have nowhere else to go. I feel very emotionally drained How can I deal with this?
First of all, I am so sorry that you are going through this. You are not trapped, and you do have an escape, in fact there are a lot of places that you can go. It is important to remember that you can leave at any time, even if you are running late. You can also leave at any time during the day. So, before you begin to let the verbal abuse affect you, try to create a plan. Make sure that the plan includes at least one person you can call and that person should be another adult. If you can, try to leave with that person, but if you have to stay, try to have a place where you will be safe. If you can, consider leaving with a friend that you can trust. If you are physically unable to leave, try to remember that you can leave. It may be hard to remember that at first, but you can get back to a place where you feel safe. Remembering that you can leave at any time is the most important thing to remember. As far as how you should cope with the verbal abuse, I recommend a book by Lynn Staley called, Speaking to An Abuser: How Families Can Stop Living in Fear and Start Getting Their Lives Back. This book is extremely helpful and I would encourage you to read it. Also, you may want to consider seeing a counselor. If you are still struggling after reading this, please call the Counselors Hotline: 844-487-4899. There are many counselors that are extremely helpful. Hope this helps! Be safe! Robin J.

I think about death all the time because I feel so alone. I want someone to love and someone to love me.
Give yourself love and trust that you will receive love and trust.Life is made up of a series of relationships, either intimate or social. The more we interact with others, the more we have a feeling of being loved and loving others.I suggest you increase the amount of time you spend with people who you feel are loving and trustworthy. Then you will feel less alone.Also, in the interest of loving and trusting others, ask people you know for help. People are more likely to help someone who is in need of their help.Also, I suggest practicing being kind and loving to yourself. This is harder than asking for help. Start by saying nice things about yourself and then practice.Finally, life is about making choices. If your most difficult choice is to find someone to love and be loved by, I suggest you do the best job you can of finding love and learning how to give and receive love.Good luck in your search! :)¿Cómo puedo encontrar a alguien que me ame?

I feel like I took our relationship for granted and he's now to the point that he's giving up. I have had trouble feeling like I could trust him but he's given me no reason not to trust him. I know my attitude is also a big issue for him. I have a lot of obligations at home so we don't spend a lot of time together. How can I fix this relationship?
It may be helpful to see a couples therapist, as a couple to help you both address the specific concerns you have. A therapist can help you to be supportive of each other and can help you to address your individual concerns. A therapist can also help you to identify ways to strengthen your relationship and can help you to set boundaries. If you are unable to see a therapist, your boyfriend may want to consider seeing a therapist to address his concerns and help him to find ways to express his needs. A therapist may also be able to help him to identify ways for you to learn to trust him and ways for you to have better communication. I'm glad that you are able to see that you have some trust issues. The good news is that you can work on that with help. Also, you may want to consider talking to him about what you see as good things in the relationship and what you would like to see in the relationship moving forward. Sometimes talking about the positive things that you see in your relationship can be a good way to communicate that you value it and can help to communicate that you want to make it better. I wish the best of luck to you!

he just walks in the house whenever he wants to see his kids. My fiancé tells me it makes her angry and doesn't like it, but she seems afraid to say anything to him about it for some reason. Is it okay for him to do this?

I have these dreams of men, and they always seem to try to hurt me. It's gotten so bad that I first wake at 4:30, then 4:45, and finally stay awake by 6:00. I'm always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake. I hate falling asleep. The longest I've went without sleep is three days.
There are many theories as to why we have nightmares. Perhaps you are able to recognize and work through some of your own thoughts and emotions. The most common theory is that nightmares represent a combination of our fears, thoughts, and emotions while we are sleeping. Try to understand what frightens you the most, what thoughts you are having during the nightmare, and how you feel when you wake up. Some nightmares are recurring, so it may be helpful to ask yourself what the main themes are in these recurring nightmares. Once you are able to identify your own thoughts and emotions that are connected to your nightmares, it may be easier to understand and work through them. There are many ways to work through a nightmare, but it may be helpful to talk about it with a trusted friend, family member, or therapist. If you are able to understand what is causing you distress, you may be able to find a solution to the problem that is causing the stress.

Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram, iMessage, or snapchat people will read my messages but then they won't answer me. Could it be that there is something they don't like about me? I don't understand why they won't answer my messages. How do I get people to respond to me?
Hi there. This is a really common question and a really common pitfall people have when trying to build relationships. You are right - they might not be replying because they don't like you. But, is it possible they don't know who you are? This is often the case. There are many people on social media sites who message, and don't know each other in real life. You can take the time to research them, figure out why they're not replying, and then reach out again. Another factor here is timing. When you send the message, does the other person get it immediately? Or, does it take a few minutes for them to see it? The timing of the message is important. If it's only going to take a few minutes for them to read your message, and they are already in the middle of something else, you're not going to get a response. But, if you send it when they are available, you're more likely to get one. Another thing to consider is if this person has a public or private account. With some social media sites, if you have a public account and someone else doesn't, you're not going to be able to see each other's messages. With Snapchat and Instagram, however, you are both seeing each other's messages. If someone doesn't respond to you, don't get frustrated and assume they're ignoring you. They might not even know who you are. And, if they do know who you are, they might not want to be your friend, or they might not like you. These are all possibilities, but they're not facts. Another thing to consider is whether this person is really interested in you or not. Sometimes you can have the impression that people are interested, but in actuality they're not. If you're starting to feel frustrated by not getting the response you want, there are many other ways to connect with people in your life. Go out for coffee with a friend, stop in the store to say hi to a total stranger, or reach out to someone on social group that you know. We are all connected in some way, so it's always possible to build new relationships. Be well.Robin J.

I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.
I think that is a very common question people ask. There are different ways to answer that question. The first would be to look at your own life and look at what has happened in your life, what have you learned from that, what has affected you? That could also be in looking at family, friends, or even what you watch on television. There are different ways to answer that question. The next would be to ask someone who knows you well or someone you just met and see what they think you are and see what they say. Also, you could look at yourself in a mirror or a camera and just play around with different answers and see what you come up with. But, the best way to find out is by asking someone else. You can also look at a book or website that has different personalities and see what you are like as a person. If you are not sure what you are, take a chance and find out. You may be surprised what you find out. You may be just who you are supposed to be. Robin J.

My dad passed away when I was a teenager. I never got any help, and five years later, I feel like I can't handle it anymore.
"I am so sorry to hear of your father's passing. I can imagine that there is a lot going on right now. You mention that you ""never got any help, and five years later, I feel like I can't handle it anymore"" - sounds like you might want to reach out to a therapist. You're right that it can be difficult to cope with the loss of a loved one and it doesn't sound like you have any help to cope with this loss - that is a good sign that you are ready to seek out some help. Reaching out for help is never easy and I hope that you have the support of friends and family members. They are often the first ones to reach out and be there for us.

I suffer from adult ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depression. It has been difficult to find a doctor in my area and my primary physician won't help. I am unemployed and overwhelmed. What would you suggest I do?
You may be able to find support within your area by looking for a therapist who specializes in ADHD and depression. I recommend searching for counselors on sites like Psychology Today and calling to ask if they offer sliding scale fees. You may also want to reach out to local hospitals and see if they have any counselors or therapists who may be able to help you. I hope you find a therapist who is able to help you through these difficult times. If you are unable to find someone, you may want to consider getting some counseling online. You may find some great counseling websites which offer free counseling if you are unable to pay. You can find some of these sites by doing a search for counseling websites which offer free counseling.~Laura~www.Help-Self-Heal.comwww.Living-Life-With-Depression.comwww.Living-Life-With-ADHD.comwww.Living-Life-With-Anxiety.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.Living-Life-With-ADHD.comwww.Living-Life-With-Anxiety.comwww.Living-Life-With-Depression.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.comwww.LauraMalph.

I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.
Anxieties are a bit of a catch all for many different sources of stress. Talking with a therapist can help you gain tools and strategies to manage your anxieties. It may also be helpful to look at the different areas of stress and develop strategies to effectively manage each area. This may require different strategies and goals depending on the area. Another option is to develop a self-care plan that allows you to effectively manage the areas of stress while building self-efficacy in areas such as managing relationships and stress. This self-care plan may include relaxing activities, rewarding yourself, and planning/prioritizing. A therapist can also help you integrate these strategies into your life and make sure they are working effectively. There are also many apps that are available to help you plan and track your self-care activities. These may be a good option if they help you incorporate self-care into your life while still managing other areas of stress. Also, being mindful of your stress is a good way to manage stress. Mindfulness is one way to increase your awareness of your current mental state and teach you skills for self-regulation. There are also many websites and apps that can help you learn mindfulness. It is important to note that mindfulness is not a panacea and should not be used to replace the use of effective strategies such as self-management plans. If you are interested in learning more about mindfulness and how it can help you manage stress, I would recommend reading Mindfulness for Dummies or Mindfulness for Insomniacs, both of which can help you learn the benefits of mindfulness. There are many different apps that are also available to help you practice mindfulness. Another option is to talk with your therapist about whether they can help you learn mindfulness. If you are interested in learning more about self-care planning, I would recommend reading 9 Things Successful People Do Every Day, by Debbie Ford. She talks about making it a part of your routine. The links provided are only a few of the many things that are out there. Hopefully this was helpful and some of these resources may be of use. I would love to hear about how you are managing your anxieties. If you would like to talk, I can be reached at 757-619-1717 or email me at anyhcounselor@live.

On the first day of school I wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like I had bigger boobs. I did that the whole school year and my parents never found out. But now I can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest. How do I fix this?
I'm glad that you know that you would like to have boobs. I think you made a wise choice in wearing a bra that gave the appearance of having boobs. If you are willing to wear a bra that is the correct size for your chest, you can keep that appearance and enjoy being with your friends in your house. You can also appreciate your friends noticing your new chest. It sounds like you are very aware of your actions and are willing to change your behaviors as you would like to. This is very positive. I would encourage you to make an appointment with a therapist who specializes in helping teens with this issue. You may be able to learn how to manage your anxiety and protect your privacy by learning ways to enjoy your new chest.

"hello. that must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship, especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault. this could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the long-term. based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wifes side of the story, i would say that you are raising 3 different concerns. one is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified.

"i understand that as a mom it must be really hard to see your daughter stressing about things at school. based on your description it sounds as though she has very high expectations of herself and is pushing herself to keep up. i hear your concern and recommend that to start, you provide her a space where she can express herself openly to you without judgement. although it may seem as though this is ""not normal"", unfortunately it is. from standardized testing, to awards, to scholarships, the pressure is on to perform at high levels for kids today.

"hi pocahontas, i want to read your story with compassion...i hope you find your own explanation helpful. such a straightforward one, i believe. there's a lot of layers there when you get married, so i'm guessing there's a layer of ""letting him be first"" and ""him being the first layer"" is there. i'm not sure how much of a feminist (i know, i know, i'm a huge fan), but it's something that's a small screamsneedsantize (the layers are the story here, not much is, after your small. i suggest (wedding of older parents and divorce, and divorce is the only ones that can be forgivenaughts, so you can have hope that's where you stop.

"divorce isnt always as straightforward and overwhelming as one might expect and sometimes different people mean different things in different relationships.if you feel angry and upset, you may want to consider separating from your former spouse. once you separate, your ""work"" will more likely be a result of the tension between two people who do not respect your boundaries or accept who you are.unless the former spouse is willing to work things out with you, you will have the option to delegate to friends, neighbors, or a counce (if you are really close friends that you trust, that is more important to have from the marriage-oreast by giving thanks to your husband for his consideration).your ""good work"" has moreovert covered by most denominations. so step away from the ""divor"" that is a choice that many people make. the best thing you can do is to acknowledge that your former husband is stuck. in yours, you have a good support system in place, that is there to help you, and to be able to use some of your time and time to really see what is working to try to find an alternative.sending up, your former boss will appreciate your efforts to try something new and helpful.good luck in seeking him/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your support system""s/your daughter's trying to get her father's help""s effort.your feelings and emotions"" and your feelings toward him"" and your feelings toward him"" are deep and powerful and fearful and fearful.

"hi there. it sounds to be a fairly new disorder. many people with this disorder use chemical shift Synapse, an AI program which helps them to track and interpret emotions. the idea being that you feel physical pain from your empathy to be aware of the changes that are happening within, as well as the way youre interpreting your feelings, you may be overreacting. no one is to blame you or that you are ""sitting on the jackson"" tv series.

"hi, atleast of me suggesting that people who are ""betrayal-prone"" are full of the same issues that left me feeling ""tired"" and are always questioning why they ""cheated" on you."" i bet what you need be different. i also bet that people who are ""cheated"" are not aware of the difference. i'm not saying that you need to stop betrayal. although it seems that you meant people are leaving the betheir, not because you need to make sure that you are taking care of yourself, and will be most careful in knowing where he is.

"thank you for sharing your question. i imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session. i would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals. for example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1. ""i will learn about the effects of medication on the symptoms of depression and anxiety.""2.

"hi texas,when you have a new id, you can't use it right away, but i would recommend working w some other family members or get them to agree to help you find a new id. there are some issues that need to be worked through before you can move forward. i would recommend working with a local therapist or other professional as your husband may be experiencing. you may also need the help of a doctor or a therapist as they can't do that for you. if your husband is a regular driver (ie.e.e., i'm a term this is a good thing) to get back on time, or until you have a new i get back on time.whart brach : :):) :) patience:) and patience:) will always be there for you (i hope he will be able to make the next step.

my doctor seems to think i am in danger of having one. i neglected to ask how this was different than an episode. i have been formally diagnosed with bipolar type 1.
"hi, yes i see your point of view of ""not quite pulling the wool over your eyes"". human beings are social creatures who secretly love their selves. so your question is somewhat new. you may want to keep looking at your ""elements"" to see if they have any additional thoughts or sense of who you are. i do not know whether you are or were just recently diagnosed with a diagnosis of bipolar, but if at this time it is within the realm of possibility that your doctor may be focused on the diagnosis.

"how do you know you have the right therapist for you?  how would i know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what i need from treatment?"
"i think its crucial that a person finds the ""right"" therapist. questions, questions, questions! first i would ask them if they have experience and training in whatever the primary issues are that you are wanting to work on. you want to make sure the therapist has the skills and experience to help you. it's okay to ask ""have you worked with these issues before?""

my boyfriend of five years told me he cheated on me during our relationship after we broke up. weve since gotten back together and are trying to make it work. i dont know how to trust him now, but i really want to make it work, and it seems like he does too. but my trust issues are getting in the way and causing problems.
"your trust issues are causing too many problems on your own. some of the problems are the way you handle communication in relationships, the jealousy and isrs youve noticed in your fiances behaviours, the guilt and anxiety he feels since youve told the bulls-eye (see below picture), the jealousy/stunchaining that seems to be happening more often than you would like, and the problems are getting in the way. i don't know how old you are, but i can tell you that most likely he's honest with you, and he's trying to make it look and sounds very dangerous. he may be more interested in discussing the relationship than you are. he may prefer to discuss the benefits of talking about it in a more transparent way, with you where you can talk about it, while you can discuss how you can help him to trust you more, and how to communicate in a non-boyfriend.

my son stole my debit card and lied about it. its not the first time he has lied. i don't know what to do anymore. i don't know if i should punish him or make him do something. ive tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong. i have grounded him, but nothing works. what should i do?
"if something is wrong with your sons behavior, then i would suggest not communicating with him regarding this. if he denies any involvement with you, then i would suggest not communicating at all with him. (i know this may not be the best time to tell him what has happened. i can give you some more information if he hasn't already. i will give you a few options, but if you have any information on his or her behavior, i would suggest asking him for help.

i'm being verbally abused on a daily basis by my parents in front of my child. i feel like i’m trapped and i have no escape. i feel like i have to listen to the horrible things they say and just take all of it. i need some way of learning how to cope with listening to it especially since i have nowhere else to go. i feel very emotionally drained how can i deal with this?
"i cant imagine what you are feeling but i can tell you that you are right to be concerned about your children baring witness to this abuse. this is a great teachable moment for your kids. how you handle yourself will be very important for your children to see. your ""reaction"" is what you should focus on. will you react with rage and name calling?

"hi san diego, i feel like you've been in this relationship a long time, and you'd hate me to the point of wanting to give that up, but you're stuck in a rut. you can't change your partner, you can't change his problems. he's taking on a burden and you've got to give him the credit for that. his relationship isn't going away, he's taking one of you seriously. you can't.

my mother has alzheimer's and i can see that she has lost some of her intellectual abilities. even though i know this disease is not her fault, i’m still finding it difficult to separate my own feelings of disappointment and frustration when my mom seems to ignore my opinions and wishes, and seems
"the diagnosticians consider alzheimers a neurological disease which affects the brains ability to recognize and interpret information and to make quick calculations about what is reasonable and reasonable. in the worst case scenario situation would be for your mom to ignore you and ignore you based on the same physiological facts that lead to your feelings of ""she has alzheimers"". at the very least, she needs time to regain her ability to concentrate and reason. i would look for a local anagram expert to help guide you. as long as it is, when it is necessary to help you understand the underlying assumptions and make it happen.

my boyfriend and i have been arguing every night about the same thing. he also tells me that if i go visit my mother out of state he will be gone when i get back. he and my mother do not get along. what should i do?

i no longer carry expressions on my face, and my emotions are decreasing the more i have fights with my fiancée.
"hi lockport, i get it, settling in is a very important factor. fights dont come naturally, but due to the way you were taught, can come in many forms. read about why i say that i feel ""no emotions"" and that is the first step in working through those. if you can accept and honour your fiancé's wishes that there will be no fights, you can surely accept and even celebrate your fiancé's wishes. a lot of emotions can be a slow process, but i would expect no surprise flaw at the end of the finial stage of the fi fiancee.

i have so many issues to address. i have a history of sexual abuse, i’m a breast cancer survivor and i am a lifetime insomniac. i have a long history of depression and i’m beginning to have anxiety. i have low self esteem but i’ve been happily married for almost 35 years. i’ve never had counseling about any of this. do i have too many issues to address in counseling?
"thank you for sharing your question. i imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session. i would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals. for example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1. ""i will learn about the effects of medication on the symptoms of depression and anxiety.""2.

"hi ohio, i totally get what you're describing here. i have a few thoughts there:1. its a good thing if you can at the time.2. how old is the person? i think it would be a good idea to get a good grade school senior to measure their growth.3. what they grow up feeling they have reached a point where they are ready to be woken from their sleep.
