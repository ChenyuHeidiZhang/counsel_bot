My issue isn't resisting angry urges; it's the anger itself. My rage is extreme and vastly disproportionate to the direct stressor. It causes violent thoughts, but I never act.

I am a counselor at day camp where we have a child with severe autism. We try to keep him entertained by carrying cards around for when he starts acting up so we can get him to focus on something else. The day camp administrator has told us not to yell at him because he will zone out and not listen, so we just talk in a calm voice. However, other kids see the treatment as unfair.
The child is a very bright child who is very sensitive to his surroundings.

I was born a girl, but I want to be a boy. Because of my religion I can't tell my family. I know they won't accept me. What do I do?
The way that I see it is that Humans have always been afraid of life and death, historically we have always tried to understand life, we try to organize it, categorize it, explore it, and we've built up this system, our system and societies system around us to help us define what life and death is, this system or way is not real but only a perception of our own value judgements, it is, no matter how you try to argue it, a false system of conditioning, humans have a finite mind and a finite mind cannot ever hope to understand an infinite mind of which a god would be. God has been developed over time as a security blanket for our child-like selves, the world is a beautifully brutal place and what is more reassuring than a master that will take care of us and show us the way. On Earth alone there are thousands of gods and even many more systems of thought, economics, societal structures and so on, it is almost as though it were a supermarket with so many choices, we have more choices in gods than we do flavors of ice cream at Baskin-Robbins, so then I ask you, "which one is real?

Having sex with your boyfriend is and was a mistake. Mistakes can be forgiven and you can make amends.But it is not the end of your relationship or God's will for you.Have a serious talk with your guy and get back on track with where you want to be. Talk to a counselor or your priest/pastor. Get someone to be your guide and mentor. Check in with them regularly.Getting back to square one could actually strengthen your relationship.Have a plan for the future where you will not be put into a place of temptation.

Whenever I sing along with a song that I like (even if it's just for the beat and not the lyrics), my boyfriend assumes that the words of the song mean something negative about our realationship. I don't why he gets so mad and assumes I mean something negative from every song. Now I can't enjoy and sing a song without him thinking I'm trying to give him a hint. He even accuses me of cheating and lying. It's driving me nuts.
You are a counselor and your client approaches you with their concern.

I like getting attention from men. I don't have sex. I lead them on to thinking I might want to. I like to tease, I like for men to chase me, and I like to feel wanted.
This is a difficult question to answer without knowing more about your personal history and motivations. From what you've described, it sounds like you might have some issues with self-esteem and attachment. It may be that you are looking for a sense of control or power in your relationships, and sex is one way to achieve this. It's also possible that you enjoy the thrill of the chase and the feeling of being wanted. If this is the case, it might be helpful for you to explore why you want these things and whether or not they are actually fulfilling for you. Additionally, it might be helpful for you to consider why you feel the need to tease and lead men on. Do these behaviors make you feel good in some way? Are you able to enjoy the interaction without these tactics? These are all questions you might want to explore with a therapist/counselor.
=== 22 ===
I have no real friends. I have a girlfriend who irritates me but loves me to death. I push her away and pushes me away. We’re going through a breakup, and I have nobody.
It sounds like you are feeling lonely and isolated. It can be difficult to open up and share our feelings, but it is essential to do so in order to feel better. Often, people need to talk to somebody in order to process their thoughts and feelings. Talking to your girlfriend can be helpful, but you may also want to reach out to a therapist or counselor to talk about what you are going through. This can be a difficult decision, but it may be the best way for you to heal.
=== 23 ===
How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?
I'm sorry to hear that you're considering ending your relationship. It's important to remember that ending a relationship is a very serious decision, and you should take your time to think about it. You might want to talk to a counselor or therapist about how you're feeling and what you should do.

My life is completely normal, yet I feel empty inside. I feel as if I already know why I'm alive: to reproduce and die.
Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling like this. It sounds like you're feeling like you're missing something important in your life. It's possible that you're feeling this way because you're not focused on anything else in your life. You might want to try looking for things that make you happy and feel fulfilled. You can also talk to a counselor to help you figure out what's wrong.
=== 25 ===
How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?
Hi there, thanks for your question.One of the things I value most is honesty. So, I will be honest with you.There is no easy answer when it comes to this question.Part of the problem is that often we don't really know ourselves very well.We often don't have all the facts and data. We make assumptions and then we second guess ourselves. Often, what we think is best for us, is not always what is actually best for us.We can get so lost in our own head that we don't even know what is going on.Another part of the problem is that sometimes, endings are difficult.We may be in a relationship where we don't want to end it, but we may also be in a relationship where the other person wants to end it.It can be hard to know what is going on.Sometimes, the best thing to do is to wait and see what happens.If the other person wants to end the relationship, then it is probably best to end it.If the other person doesn't want to end the relationship, then it may be best to try to work things out.In any case, it is important to remember that you are not alone and that there are people who can help you make the decision that is best for you.

My husband and I are separated and he doesn't even want to talk to me. He says he doesn't love me anymore, but I would do anything to get him back. Is there any hope?
It's very difficult to try and get through a divorce without talking to one another. Often times one spouse will try to hold onto the relationship in an effort to stay in control. It may be difficult for you to hear this, but it is the truth.There may be hope but it will require both of you to be willing to work through your issues.
=== 27 ===
I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.
Hello, and thank you for taking the time to write in. It sounds as if you are struggling with a lot of emotions and you don't really know where to turn for help. It can be incredibly difficult to feel like you don't know who you are or what you should do. In the midst of all of this uncertainty, it is important to remember that you are not alone.

She said she needed space after three days of dating, and she got a boyfriend a week later. I still really miss her, and she told me she still likes me.
It sounds like you are feeling attached to her and you don't want to lose her. It's natural to feel this way, especially since you are invested in the relationship. You might want to reach out to her and talk about what happened. When two people are in a relationship, there is always a possibility for hurt feelings and misunderstandings. It can be difficult to communicate and resolve these issues, but it is important to do so in order to maintain the relationship.

About 3 years ago or so I was skinny, but I was still ugly. I really do want to change that but I've tried 3 times. Now can I try but don't stop. At school I get bullied about my weight and my ugliness and I have been bullied my whole life that I believe them. How can I stop thinking about them and don't let it get in my head?
It sounds like you are carrying a lot of baggage around your appearance. It is important that you start by looking at your thoughts and feelings around your weight and appearance. It is likely that you are focusing on the negative aspects of your appearance and this is not helping you to make progress. Start by identifying the thoughts that come up when you think about your weight or appearance. Once you know what thoughts are keeping you from making progress, you can start to challenge those thoughts. You might also find it helpful to write down your thoughts and feelings about your weight and appearance. Doing this will help you to monitor and manage your thoughts in a healthy way.

It's been almost a year since my ex-boyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me many times. I had found out about a month before, but I hadn't told him I knew because I didn't want us to break up. I used to have very low self-esteem, and I think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic. My father cheated on my mother when I was little. I wonder if this pain has to do with that.
There is definitely some pain associated with your experience with your father's infidelity. It is possible that this pain has a genetic component and you may be more prone to experience similar pain in your relationships. It is also possible that your experience with your ex-boyfriend breaking up with you has contributed to your low self-esteem. It is important for you to understand that you are not alone in experiencing these feelings and that there is nothing wrong with you. You deserve to be happy and content in your life.

He had a sexual relationship with his sister and kept it from me for years, I confronted about it and he finally told me what happened. But I dont think he is telling me the whole story. He works with her and sees her every day. I feel that I shouldn't stay with him , but he says he ended it long time ago. Should I trust my husband and stay with him?
It's really difficult to make a decision like this when so much is riding on it. On the one hand, you have a strong emotional connection to your husband. On the other hand, you feel hurt, betrayed, and confused. It sounds like you're stuck in a difficult situation. The most important thing for you to do is to take some time for yourself. You need to process all of the information you've received and figure out what you want to do. You can't make a decision if you're too busy trying to resolve all of the conflict in your head. Ultimately, it's up to you whether or not you stay with your husband. However, it's important to remember that you're not the only person involved in this relationship. Your husband may have a different story than what you've been told. You need to be sure that you have all of the facts before making any decisions.
=== 32 ===
I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.
It's difficult to come to terms with who we are and what we want when we're constantly living in the shadow of other people's expectations. It's okay to not know the answer right now. Just keep asking yourself questions like "Who am I? What do I want?" and "What can I do to make myself happy?" These are the questions that will help you figure out who you are.

My dad passed away when I was a teenager. I never got any help, and five years later, I feel like I can't handle it anymore.
I'm so sorry that you experienced such a difficult time in your life. It sounds like you have been carrying this pain for a long time. It's important to remember that you are not alone. Many people experience difficult times and don't get help. It's important that you reach out for help. There are many resources available, including counseling, support groups, and online resources.If you find it difficult to access these resources, there are often people available to talk to on a telephone or online.I hope that this helps.

I sleep a lot. Music changes my mood. I cry every Wednesday. My mind is like a maze that even I get lost in. I don't usually feel my true emotions, but instead, I get fake mirrored ones.
That sounds like a difficult situation. It's possible that you are experiencing a form of dissociation in which you lose touch with your true feelings. Dissociation is a protective mechanism which allows us to distance ourselves from potentially harmful or overwhelming situations. Dissociative symptoms can be very distressing and can interfere with daily life.If you are able to talk about what is happening for you, it may help to find a therapist who can help you work through these issues.

Hi Nikki, I'm sorry to hear that you've been struggling with this. It sounds like there is a lot of pain and hurt attached to this. It's normal to feel this way after a traumatic event like this. You might find it helpful to talk about what happened and how you're feeling. It's also possible that there is a lot of self-hatred going on. It can be helpful to explore this with a therapist who can help you to understand the thoughts and feelings that are driving this.
=== 36 ===
I feel like I'm trying to convince myself that I'm okay when I'm not. I'm always blocking out the bad things and forgetting. I also feel like nobody cares for me and they never will. I feel truly alone.
It sounds like you are trying to be strong when you are not. It can be difficult to remember the bad moments, but it is important to tell someone. Talking to someone can help you to process and remember the events in a more organized way. You are not alone.

My roommate has had a drinking problem for a while. She goes out, gets trashed, and then expects everyone to take care of her. The next morning, she apologizes constantly until she feels validated. She also thinks everyone hates her all the time. If I don't seem anything other than happy, she asks me "Do you hate me?
It sounds like your roommate is seeking your approval and affirmation in order to feel okay about herself. She also seems to feel that if you don't love her, then you must hate her. This can be really difficult to deal with because it feels like you are on the receiving end of a kind of emotional blackmail. One way to begin to process this is to try to empathize with your roommate's position. For example, if you were in her shoes, what would you want?Another possibility is that your roommate may have difficulty regulating her emotions. In other words, she may have a hard time distinguishing between what is actually happening and what she is thinking or feeling. In situations like this, it can be helpful to have someone to talk to about what is going on for her. Someone who is objective and can provide support.Alternatively, your roommate may simply need some time to adjust to her situation. In the meantime, it may be helpful to be understanding and supportive.

I'm a male in my early 20s. Lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. I then start to act weird because I'm trying to fight my paranoia. This leads to people starring at me because they don't know that I'm suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. They just notice me acting scared around kids and they think I'm a threat because of it. I'm not a pervert or predator. I would never hurt a kid. I like kids and don't know why I'm so scared to be around them. I don't understand why I feel like this. Am I a bad person? How do I make this stop?

My boyfriend and I have a terrible sex life after three years of dating, and I don't know what to do. I have this lingering fear of pain during sex after having two partners previously who weren't careful. How can I stop projecting this onto my current boyfriend?
Hi, I'm sorry this is happening to you. I would think about what in your past relationships contributes to this fear. You may be feeling that you can't trust this person to be gentle, or you may feel your past partners were not really into you. You may want to explore these ideas with a therapist. One thing I would try is to have sex without a condom. Use a diaphragm if you have one. That way, if it does hurt a bit, you will know it is your body's response and not fear. This fear can really affect your desire to have sex, so making yourself approachable to your own body can help. Also, being able to talk about what you like and don't like during sex can help with this. All of this sounds more complicated than I have here, but it can help to have a therapist help you explore this further. Good luck!

He's lied about his past/present situations. Since time has passed, he has changed, but I still have my doubts. I have no idea if I should stay or go, but I hate this feeling. I don't trust him all too much, but yet he hasn't done anything for me not to trust him recently.
Trust is essential for any relationship and if you do not trust your partner this may be a strong reason to end the relationship.There are ways to increase your trust in your partner.You can ask questions about his past and present life to find out more about him.If you feel hesitant about trusting him, then tell him what you expect of him in terms of trust.If he does not meet your expectations, then you can end the relationship.If he does meet your expectations, then you will have more trust in the relationship.Ask yourself why you are hesitant to trust him and what you expect from him to increase your trust in him.Maybe you expect that he would cheat on you or tell you something that may be untrue.Without knowing your reasons, then it is difficult to tell you what to do.Do you want to stay in the relationship or not?This is your decision and only you can know if staying in the relationship is right for you and your partner.Start by having open discussions with your partner about your feelings and expectations. With this, you will feel more secure in your partner and your feelings of trust. You may also decide together to either stay together or not. This discussion may feel difficult or even stressful at first. You will both learn more about each other and your relationship by having these discussions. This is not easy, but it is necessary. With these discussions and learning more about each other, then you will have a better sense of trust in the relationship.Warm wishes to both of you!

I was never single, afraid to be alone, and I looked for my boyfriend to make me happy. I finally worked on my self, was in a relationship, and I did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didn't work out. Now months later, no man peaks my interest. Am I ready to date again? Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?
"Hi Seattle, The most important thing is to accept that relationships and love just doesn't work out all the time. It's okay to be heartbroken and to grieve the loss. You may have outgrown the relationships in your past. I'm sure you can understand that now that you've had time to see the bad parts of relationships and heal from the wounds.I agree that it's possible that no man peaked your interest because there were no ""spark"". Maybe you weren't ready to date again. It's also possible that you're over a year out of the relationship, and if you date someone new again, you'll go through all the painful memories again, and it will be too much.I'm impressed with how much you've changed and that you've worked on your self. I'm not sure what you mean when you say you ""looked for a boyfriend to make me happy"", but you may have been looking for someone who wasn't going to make you happy. If you're not happy and he's not good for you, you're going to end up heartbroken. It's good that you're not afraid to be alone now. It's true that we can get used to being alone and can start missing the companionship and love. Try not to look for a boyfriend too quickly. If you're not ready to date and you're not really missing dating, maybe you're in the right place right now.I agree that if you're in a place where no one sparks your interest and you're not ready to date again, it's okay to hold off. You're a smart, mature woman. Give yourself permission to be in the place where you are right now. You're healing. You're ready. We're all in this place at different stages in our lives.I wish you the best.""Love is just a four-letter word.""The one who does not love does not hurt, nor does the one who is hurting.""Be careful about reading meaning into love!

"Can a counselor take sides with one parent and allow a parent to order the child to tell the counselor ""every detail"" about what happened during the other parent’s visitation in order to help build a case for child custody?"
I don't think a therapist would take sides with a parent and allow them to order the child to tell the therapist ""every detail"" about what happened during the other parent's visitation. I do think that a therapist would encourage the child to speak to them if they felt it would help in the child's healing process. In fact, the therapist might even suggest that the child do so.As a general rule, therapists do not participate in custody proceedings. In order to be able to provide the best support and care to a child, a therapist should not be getting involved in the process in any way. Even if the therapist was asked to assist in court proceedings, they would still be bound by the Code of Ethics and refuse to act in a way that conflicted with their Code of Ethics. If a child is being abused, a therapist may become involved in helping to protect the child from further harm, regardless of who the alleged perpetrator is. This is especially important if the therapist has any concerns about the competence of one parent in caring for the child. I'm not saying that this would be the case here, but I think it's worth noting that a therapist could intervene in this situation.I'm not sure how this question is being asked, but it seems like there are some other aspects that need to be considered as well. I wonder what your questions are?

I feel angry, anxious, and depressed. The PTSD I suffer is from a past relationship.
"I agree with the other answers here, and will add one thing: One of the best ways to work with any traumatic or traumatic experiences that you have had is through meditation. In meditation, you sit with the discomfort of a traumatic experience and allow it to be present with you, but not overwhelming you. Then, you learn to observe the experiences and sensations as if you were an outside observer, detached from the experience. You would be able to do this through meditation. Once you learn to be an outside observer, you can then work on your feelings about the event and what you are going through now. Even if you have no memory of the traumatic experience, the distress of it can affect you in many ways. And, now, if you have never dealt with that event directly, your brain is likely to ""react"" to that experience in the future by reminding you of it in future situations. In order for this to be resolved, you need to be able to bring awareness to the event and understand it on an emotional level, which allows you to have a new understanding of what it meant to you, and helps you feel more at ease. The result of this would be a sense of peace. I would recommend a trauma therapist who uses mindfulness and exposure therapy to help with this. Best of luck!

"My wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that I'm doing things she finds disrespectful even when I don't mean it like that. For example, she gets offended when I call someone at work ""sweetheart."" I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her. She doesn't, and never will say she was wrong. How do I get her to understand?"
"For many people, a discussion about sensitive topics can make the atmosphere feel more tense and emotional. The best way I've found to reduce the intensity of this type of discussion is to have it when you both are feeling calm. I suggest having a discussion when you're both not angry but also not feeling neutral. If you're feeling frustrated, then you're likely to be more emotional and reactive. You can have these discussions when both of you are at work or out with your families. It's best to have the discussion when you have a calm time where you can just focus on what you want to discuss. Going to a counselor will allow you to have the discussion with a neutral person who can help you identify your needs and her needs. You can help her understand your experience and she can explain hers. This will help you understand each other better and minimize the risk of the discussion escalating."I hope this helps. :-)"Carmen Rodriguez, LMHCP, LMCC"I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her."I don't, and never will say she was wrong."How do I get her to understand?

When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much. I’m afraid it’s going to break her. I don't know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.
I'm sorry that you are going through this. You may be right, it is not normal for your daughter to be stressing out so much. I think the best thing you can do is to sit down with your daughter and let her know that you see that she is stressed out and you want to help her. You can tell her that you believe she is working really hard and that it is not normal for her to be stressing out like this. Then you can offer to do things for her to help her. I would recommend that you get in contact with a counselor or therapist that can help both of you. This is not something that you can do on your own. If your daughter is not comfortable with you contacting a counselor, that is ok. You can either try to find a counselor that you can talk to, or you can find a therapist on the phone and try them out for a week or two. If you don't like it, try someone else. If your daughter does not want to talk to you or is not comfortable with you trying to help her, you can always try to find a counselor that can help her. They may be able to do things that you can't do or won't do. I hope this helps. Please remember that you can always come to me with your concerns. I would love to help you and your daughter.Warm regards,Laura Spencer, LMSW~ therapist and author~www.LSWLC.com~www.LivingSelfHealing.com~www.LivingWellGutsy.com~www.LivingWellMama.com~www.LivingWellWoman.com~www.LivingWellSelf.com~www.LivingWellSelfHealing.com~www.LivingWellSelfCoaching.com~www.LivingWellSelfHealing.org~www.LivingWellSelfCoaching.org~www.LivingWellSelfWellness.org~www.LivingWellHome.org~www.LivingWellWellness.org~www.LivingWellWellBeing.org~www.LivingWellRelationships.org~www.LivingWellSelfCoaching.org~www.LivingWellSelfHealing.org~www.LivingWellRelationships.org~www.LivingWellSelfCoaching.org~www.LivingWellSelfHealing.org~www.LivingWellSelfBeing.org~www.LivingWellSelfBeingWell.org~www.LivingWellSelfBeingWell.

My fiancé of 15 years is always helping out his family, and I feel like his family takes advantage of his kindness. We're about to get married this Saturday, but I feel like he is always gonna put them first instead of myself and our three kids. I am not enjoying our engagement at all.
One thing that I wonder is if you are having difficulty with communicating in the relationship.One of the main tasks in therapy is to be able to discuss different topics and feelings. As part of this, the therapist will ask questions to help you and your partner open up to one another. In the process of doing this, you will learn more about each other and you may learn new information about yourself that will change how you feel about the relationship.I hope this helps. I wish you the best in your wedding!

I am going through a divorce. He is extremely angry. He refuses to physically assist me with our teenager daughter. I have no extended family support. Often times, I feel overwhelmed, tired, and joyless. I feel out of control, sad and depressed on a daily basis. I am just going through the motions of life every day. I am in my mid-50s. I have almost 29 years on my job. How can I handle this?
The relationship you have with your ex is the source of your depression and sense of out of control feelings.Your partner’s unwillingness to assist you with your daughter is a reflection of the person he is.This doesn’t mean the fault is with you or your daughter.Divorce affects all the parties.Especially if there was an abusive relationship, it takes time and energy to process and heal from the relationship.Its normal to feel depressed and sad after such a significant break up.Try to see your relationship as a learning experience. The lesson is that this relationship is over. And you are the one to decide when you are ready for a new relationship. And you are the one who will make this decision by living the life you want to live. This may be time to do things on your own or with the help of a trusted friend or neighbor.Also, re-evaluate your own sense of self-worth. Are you doing the best job you can?

We weren't long distance until he joined the military. I love him and I know he loves, me but it's complicated. He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid. How do I keep our relationship going?
This is a great question. It sounds like you are both wanting a long-distance relationship and are very concerned that he may find someone else. You could both just continue to be honest with each other about your feelings. Each of you could write out what you want from the relationship and then discuss it as a family. Maybe you could start off by sharing with each other what you want and then discuss how that is possible within the military rules. You could also share with him what your fears are and ask him if he could try to reassure you that he is not going to leave. This can be a regular conversation. You could also consider asking him to write a letter to you while he is away. You could share it with your family or have it sent to you. I am sure that he would appreciate the reassurance that you are thinking about him. Good luck!

My doctor seems to think I am in danger of having one. I neglected to ask how this was different than an episode. I have been formally diagnosed with bipolar type 1.
"Hi, I'm sorry to hear about your family members' difficulties. Bipolar disorder is a serious illness that affects the whole family. You can help the rest of the family by recognizing that these people are struggling, and not blaming them for it. I've seen this kind of thing happen with family members who aren't aware that bipolar disorder is a physical illness. They ""catch"" it because someone else is getting sick, or they're drinking too much, or they've been away from their support system too long. Bipolar disorder is treatable, and once you've been diagnosed and treated, you will be able to live a normal life and do the things that are important to you. If your family members are having difficulties, make sure they are getting the proper care and treatment. If they are getting treatment, it's a good idea for you to be a part of it, because it's likely that they will need support and encouragement. This is your family members' health, too, and it's important that they get the care that they need. Best wishes for your family's health. Robin J.

"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?  How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?"
This is a really important question. The thing is, every therapist is different. Some therapists are better at working with issues that you may have and some are better at working with issues that your friends may have. But, the good thing is that you can learn to talk to your therapist about what you need. Your therapist is there to support you throughout your whole journey and they can help you figure out how to get the most out of your sessions. If you feel like you are getting the most out of your sessions but your therapist is not helping you out figure out what you need, you may want to find a therapist who can help you get the most out of your sessions.To give you a general idea of how to find the right therapist:1. If you are looking for a therapist that works in a particular area that you have an issue, you can Google them. (Don't forget to read their website!

I feel angry, anxious, and depressed. The PTSD I suffer is from a past relationship.
I'm sorry to hear that you are feeling this way. PTSD is a complex medical condition that can be caused by a variety of traumatic events. It can also be the result of a life event such as a car accident, a suicide attempt, or a violent incident. There are many different ways that PTSD can develop and it can be difficult to pinpoint the specific event that caused you to experience these symptoms. I would encourage you to talk with your doctor about any medications you are taking, talk with your therapist, and seek the help of a qualified mental health professional if you have questions about your symptoms. Best of luck to you and your family!

im scared that i am with this man so i wont be alone. he should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case, and i don’t want to hurt him.
"thanks for reaching out. this is a tough situation. it would be my understanding that you are very hesitant to leave this man. i don't know how old this man is, but i can tell you that if he is worth more to you than him, and i don't want to hurt him either. however, i can also understand how unsure he is about being with someone.

im a male in my early 20s. lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. i then start to act weird because i'm trying to fight my paranoia. this leads to people starring at me because they don't know that i'm suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. they just notice me acting scared around kids and they think i'm a threat because of it. i'm not a pervert or predator. i would never hurt a kid. i like kids and don't know why i'm so scared to be around them. i dont understand why i feel like this. am i a bad person? how do i make this stop?
"in our practice, many people we see have unwanted thoughts of doing harm to children - physically or sexually. as you said, these are intrusive and unwanted thoughts - not genuine desires to harm them. this is a form of ocd we often call harm or pedophilic ocd. what you are describing here as ""paranoia"" sounds similar to this, and is so demoralizing because you are dealing both with the distress of these unwanted thoughts and feelings, as well as the fear and uncertainty about your own character as a good person.if this is really what is going on (further assessment by the right professional would determine this), the current gold standard approach to addressing ocd is exposure with response prevention - in this case, confronting the feared situations, thoughts or images on purpose, rather than avoiding them, until they lose the fear and shame associated with them."" this is a coping response to the threat.
=== 23 ===
is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?
"yes, it is normal to cry during therapy, it is a time of catharsis, letting things out, shedding our skin, dropping our weights and just to let you know, even therapists sometimes feel like crying in sessions. although people often cry or become upset, it is in no way a measure of ""good therapy"". c"s come in many forms, and there is no measurement that we can use to measure emotions. although people are people, and crying is a form of cathars tears, no guarantees, just a measure to make sure you are 100% sure your ""complain,"" also very likely carries some measure of tissues and other things. not all of usday thing we need to cry.
=== 24 ===
i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky. is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?
"thank you for your question. its completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session. many people report having felt this way. i can't say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session. for many people, it can take weeks, months, or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session.

my boyfriend and i have a terrible sex life after three years of dating, and i dont know what to do. i have this lingering fear of pain during sex after having two partners previously who werent careful. how can i stop projecting this onto my current boyfriend?
"thanks for reaching out. this is a great question and i am very glad you wrote it, it'sounded like you have some great sex experience with your current boyfriend. there are usually a few of us who have this lingering fear of pain, ""what if we did really badly?"" or maybe it was something about a previous relationship that didnt get the heat of the moment. i am going to assume that you have a very bad sex experience and this sex experience is not a good sex - if you have done this, you will not be hurt at all; if you were really terrible at sex if you really sex, then the lingering fear will quickly linger, ""weaksex"" that's just a terrible experience, and then you will no longer be a bad or terrible sexual experience again.

"i can't say that you have absolute ""no"" decisions to make, but i will say that you have major options. you can decide to stay or go. i would not hesitate for long (unless you absolutely, like me, hate him) if i could help you sort this out. for one thing, i can tell you have options. you can ask him about his communication style, tell him your reasons for staying.

i was never single, afraid to be alone, and i looked for my boyfriend to make me happy. i finally worked on my self, was in a relationship, and i did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didn't work out. now months later, no man peaks my interest. am i ready to date again? is there a reason no one sparks my interest?
"hi pocahontas, im sorry you had this intense feeling of wanting to be with someone, and now no one is watching.i wonder if the pressure of ""getting someone to make you happy"" has now lifted from you? oh, and relationships can present some challenges (if they do overlap, and/or you suddenly feel more attractive, not less so, because dating a healthy, single, successful person is something you will probably enjoy and look forward to doing.) and maybe even a few things, if you're a single, maybe paired up and made some mistakes because now you're not quite sure you'd like someone who cares about you. having said that, what i would say to someone, is that they have learned about themselves and had doubts about what they would have liked from hearing about that. and, having a partner who cares about others, is a huge advantage to a relationship.

"can a counselor take sides with one parent and allow a parent to order the child to tell the counselor ""every detail"" about what happened during the other parent’s visitation in order to help build a case for child custody?"
"hello. i can't really make you do anything ""no"" but many clients do. the best thing for them is for them to be able to tell the parents in writing what they can (as the parent or a legal guardian could) about what happened (i.e., ask the parent to order an oral recount during a custody hearing, etc.). you can have the parent write out their ""every detail"" because that can be extremely difficult to do. and, if it is not something that they wrote down for what the parents can and can and should be done by the parents.

every winter i find myself getting sad because of the weather. how can i fight this?
"thank you for sharing. it seems like since the ""winter blues"" happens to you every year it may also be impacting your quality of life and possibly relationships. what you report sounds like you may be experiencing seasonal affective disorder (sad) and is quite common to many from about fall thru winter seasons; but, also can impact folks during the spring and summer months.the best care and treatment for sad includes discussing it with your pcp (primary care physician), integrating light therapy (full-spectrum lighting) throughout home and workplace (where possible), psychotherapy, and possibly medications (e.g. wellbutrin xl, aplenzin).be sure to exercise good self-care and checkout the mayo clinic's website for sad here: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/basics/definition/con-20021047."" perhaps you focus on these core issues when we can not really focus on a certain area or problem.one thing that i would suggest is a specific book you can read, ""the winter wonders of the winter season.""

"hello. that must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship, especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault. this could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the long-term. based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wifes side of the story, i would say that you are raising 3 different concerns. one is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified.

"i understand that as a mom it must be really hard to see your daughter stressing about things at school. based on your description it sounds as though she has very high expectations of herself and is pushing herself to keep up. i hear your concern and recommend that to start, you provide her a space where she can express herself openly to you without judgement. although it may seem as though this is ""not normal"", unfortunately it is. from standardized testing, to awards, to scholarships, the pressure is on to perform at high levels for kids today.

"hi pocahontas, i want to read your story with compassion...i hope you find your own explanation helpful. such a straightforward one, i believe. there's a lot of layers there when you get married, so i'm guessing there's a layer of ""letting him be first"" and ""him being the first layer"" is there. i'm not sure how much of a feminist (i know, i know, i'm a huge fan), but it's something that's a small screamsneedsantize (the layers are the story here, not much is, after your small. i suggest (wedding of older parents and divorce, and divorce is the only ones that can be forgivenaughts, so you can have hope that's where you stop.

"divorce isnt always as straightforward and overwhelming as one might expect and sometimes different people mean different things in different relationships.if you feel angry and upset, you may want to consider separating from your former spouse. once you separate, your ""work"" will more likely be a result of the tension between two people who do not respect your boundaries or accept who you are.unless the former spouse is willing to work things out with you, you will have the option to delegate to friends, neighbors, or a counce (if you are really close friends that you trust, that is more important to have from the marriage-oreast by giving thanks to your husband for his consideration).your ""good work"" has moreovert covered by most denominations. so step away from the ""divor"" that is a choice that many people make. the best thing you can do is to acknowledge that your former husband is stuck. in yours, you have a good support system in place, that is there to help you, and to be able to use some of your time and time to really see what is working to try to find an alternative.sending up, your former boss will appreciate your efforts to try something new and helpful.good luck in seeking him/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your daughter's/your support system""s/your daughter's trying to get her father's help""s effort.your feelings and emotions"" and your feelings toward him"" and your feelings toward him"" are deep and powerful and fearful and fearful.

"hi there. it sounds to be a fairly new disorder. many people with this disorder use chemical shift Synapse, an AI program which helps them to track and interpret emotions. the idea being that you feel physical pain from your empathy to be aware of the changes that are happening within, as well as the way youre interpreting your feelings, you may be overreacting. no one is to blame you or that you are ""sitting on the jackson"" tv series.

my fiancé and i broke up. he cheated on me numerous times. i kept forgiving but questioning his every move. he got tired and left.
"hi, atleast of me suggesting that people who are ""betrayal-prone"" are full of the same issues that left me feeling ""tired"" and are always questioning why they ""cheated" on you."" i bet what you need be different. i also bet that people who are ""cheated"" are not aware of the difference. i'm not saying that you need to stop betrayal. although it seems that you meant people are leaving the betheir, not because you need to make sure that you are taking care of yourself, and will be most careful in knowing where he is.

My mother is combative with me when I say I don't want to talk with her about my depression. She hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I don't want to or can't answer. I tell her I don't want to talk and she starts arguments with me. How can I get her to understand?

I'm a Christian teenage girl, and I have lost my virginity. My boyfriend is a Christian teenager too, but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner. I planned to abstain from sex but I guess I wasn't clear about this because I was also tempted and led him on. We continued to have sex. Does it mean that he isn't the one God planned for me?

I'm in my late 50s. I never loved or have been loved. I need deeper help than is offered in my small town, but I cannot leave this town because of agoraphobia. I find myself losing hope more and more. My brain barely works anymore, and my memory so small, I forget in a moment.

I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.

How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?
When counseling sessions are over, counselors generally have several goals in mind. These goals might include helping the client achieve their goals, resolving any issues that have been brought up, and teaching the client about different approaches to problem solving.In cases where it is clear that the counseling is not helping the client, or where the client is unwilling or unable to work on resolving issues, the counselor may decide to end the counseling session. This might be done in a phone call, in person, or in a letter.
