I’ve been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for just over a year. This past week she admitted to me that she has feelings for another guy. She says it’s “just a crush” but I don't know how to cope with it. How should I deal with this?
While difficult, a long distance relationship can provide some difficulties as well. I have to say that many people have been in a long distance relationship and they were not loving at all.Your girlfriend has a crush and she is in the process of knowing what she wants.In the meantime, she wants to be with you.What do you want?Stay true to your wishes and give her space.Do not try to persuade her to come back.Give her time to understand what she wants, who she is and what she is looking for in a relationship.Do not try to rush her.Wait and see how she is doing and if she wants to work on the relationship.From what you write, it sounds as if you care a great deal about her and it is obvious that you are very much in love with her.Trust that she is having her own process and give her time.There is always hope that she will come back.Sending lots of caring energy your way!

I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.
"A lot of times the past holds on to us and we are not completely able to release it. The good news is that we can release it. Releasing is different than denying. Releasing means it is out of your system and you are moving forward. Denial means you are not facing the issue but you are avoiding it. Avoidance is a sign of fear, but fear doesn't have to control you. You can be at peace with your past and move forward into your present and future. You are not a prisoner to your past. With the right tools you can move forward, have peace and build a brighter future. I highly recommend seeking the guidance of a professional therapist. Most places offer free consultation and that is a great time to get all your questions answered. Good luck, you can do this!

"I'm in my early 20s, and I've been seeing my boyfriend for a year now. My boyfriend has always been the sweetest guy until recently. He has made comments such as “you would look better as a Tumblr girl"" or ""you should start doing more squats."" It's really hurtful."
It is never okay to make comments that are hurtful.

I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?
I think it is perfectly normal to feel a little nervous when you go to counseling. Many people feel a lot of anxiety when they go to talk to someone they don't know. Therapy is an opportunity to talk about things that might be difficult to talk about with a stranger. If you feel comfortable with your therapist and things have gone well in the past I wouldn't see it as a problem. However, if you feel like you aren't getting through to your therapist or that you aren't feeling comfortable you might want to find a therapist you do feel comfortable with. This can make a big difference. It can help you to be more open and share your concerns. I hope this was helpful. I wish you the best of luck!

There are issues from my past that have me very heavily burdened in my heart. I've been torn for so many years and I need help so I can move on with my life. I experienced trauma when I was 8 years old and I did come out about it until I was 40. Now I know this is what's holding me back on my happiness. I've met a very loving and caring man but because I'm holding on to these things from my past I’m pushing him away. How can I get my life back?
As much as I want to say in this answer that there is a simple solution that you just need to do, it doesn't work like that.

My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.
I am sorry you lost your engagement.You are within your rights to make decisions which are what you feel are best for you.Breaking up with someone you are with, is a major decision.If you feel you were not getting what you wanted in the relationship, then your decision to end the engagement was the right one.Basically, if you were not happy, then you were justified in ending the engagement.Start by deciding whether you are happy with the decision to end the engagement. This way you will know that you did the right thing. If you decide to start over, you'll be clear as to what you are willing to offer another person.If you were happy, then congratulations on knowing your own happiness. You handled the breakup in a clear and decisive way.Hopefully you'll find a new partner who feels the same way you do!I wish you the best! ¿Cómo debería de haber hecho?

I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.  I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.
It's very common for parents to misunderstand and not to 'get' what their kids are saying, because we don't get your language. People need to be educated that LGBTQQ people exist, and there is more to your life than what you have experienced with your parents. The best thing you can do for yourself is seek out a local therapist who specializes in working with LGBTQ issues, and share with your therapist what you are going through. You can trust your therapist to know how best to guide you. You may not want to trust your parents, but at least you can trust a person who has your best interests at heart. I hope that you find the support you need. And that your parents will come to understand what it is like to be undervalued and misunderstood by those they care most about.

He wants to wear makeup and heels. He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. I have tried this for him, but I don’t like it and have told him so. He keeps making comments about it and says he can't live without it.
"The best thing you can do is to tell him that you are not comfortable with him dressing in this way, and if he continues to do so, then you will not continue to be in a relationship with him.

Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out. How can I stop these thoughts?
"Hello, and thank you for your question. I have had many people ask me this over the years, and the answer is not simple, because it is a dynamic interaction between thoughts and our belief system. The ""scary thought"" is a thought in your mind that scares you. It could be something that you have seen in the media, on the street, or even something that you have read on the internet. What happens is that when we have an emotion that scares us, our mind has several automatic responses that happen to try and deal with the emotion. Sometimes these responses are things that we ""just don't want to deal with,"" but unfortunately we have to (it's how the human brain works). But here's the thing...we don't really want those things. We really want the emotion to stop, but our brain has not taught us how to stop these automatic responses, so we don't know how to stop them. We can, however, stop them from having power over us. So how do we stop the response? What if we stopped the response and replaced it with something else? You might be asking yourself what you could replace that response with. Your brain knows what it is telling you. It is telling you that the scary thought is a fact, and that ""fact"" is going to happen, so you better believe it!

I'm a teenager. My dad has been jail for the last five years. It's tough, but my mom really tries to give a normal life to my two sisters, my brother, and I. I feel like I took upon a parent role when I'm the second youngest, and I'm not stable. My mother and sisters say I'm overdramatic. I’m just so hurt, and I keep breaking down.
What has been helpful for you is to communicate your feelings to someone that you trust. This could be a friend, family member, or another adult. If you can find someone that you can talk to about your feelings, it will make it easier for you to express yourself. Although your feelings are tough to experience, being able to talk about them with someone that you trust will help relieve some of the burden. Keep in mind that you may feel a lot of things during this time. It is normal to feel sadness, loneliness, anger, and a lot of other things that you may experience. You may even feel a lot of different emotions at the same time. The best thing you can do is express yourself and keep track of your feelings. It is important to have a record of your emotions so that you can track your emotions as they come and go. This way, you can be aware of what is happening and learn to accept yourself. Remember that you are not alone and that there are a lot of people out there that are feeling the same way that you are feeling. We all experience tough emotions at times and it is okay to talk about how we feel. Now that you have expressed yourself, it is time to reflect and learn from your experiences and how you are feeling. Reflecting on what you learned from the experience can help you cope with your situation. If you learned anything from your experience, you will have a better idea of what to do next time that you may encounter a similar situation. For example, if you learned that you could not handle a situation and it made you feel sad, you could learn to take time to cope with your emotions by talking to someone you trust or by doing something that you enjoy. Although you may be feeling a lot of different emotions, learning to cope with those emotions and accept yourself can help you in the long run. I suggest that you consider seeing a counselor so that you can begin to cope with these emotions in a healthy way. A counselor can provide you with resources and help you learn coping skills that will allow you to deal with your emotions in a healthy and productive way. A counselor can also provide a safe environment for you to discuss your feelings. Remember that it is okay to feel how you feel and that you are not alone. Remember that learning to cope with your emotions is a process.

I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac. I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years. I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?

"My boyfriend and I have been together for five years now. Throughout the entire first day that we met, he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. That same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom's acknowledgment) and we kissed. The next two days were a repetition of the first day. On the third night, my mother finally caught us, and I was kicked out of my house. I left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. It was very hard for us. His stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot. Our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. After that, it was a downward spiral. We were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. We kept having the famous ""you're doing it wrong—do it this way"" argument. After six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. One afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. He told me to let him leave or he would hit me. He had once promised he would never touch me, so I challenged him to do it. He slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. I haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. I don't live with him, I don't depend on him, and we don't have children. We both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. He always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. Now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how I don't ever make the effort to try to be okay. I've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. I know he has to change that on his own. I just want to know if there's people who have gone through this and had the tables turned? Is there hope for a better future together?"
"Definitely there is hope for a better future together. Why don't you go to a domestic violence shelter and take some classes?

I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.
"Hi Seattle, I can tell you feel bad about exposing yourself in front of your classmates and I agree that it was embarrassing. When you've got a hard-on, your whole body says ""Look at me!"" You're not the only one who's hard. Especially in public. It's a primal thing, and embarrassing as it was, it was perfectly normal. If we didn't have hard-ons all the time, we'd have to cover them up. I'm an avid swimmer, and I know that people don't tend to wear swimsuits in the pool at the Y in downtown Seattle. People are getting naked. Naked. Every day. In the pool. Of course we're going to get hard. People are naked. In the pool. All the time. Your hard-on was a healthy one; you're used to being naked in the water. Do you find yourself hard-up?

I'm a teenage girl, and my dad is an alcoholic. I hate being at home with him because he just stresses me out. He can be picking me up from basketball practice or piano lessons, and half of the time, I don't even know if he's sober or not. I refuse to get into the vehicle with him and walk home sometimes. I've either been barely sleeping or I over sleep, so I'm always tired. I live in a small town, so there's no one I can really talk to because I'm not really that close with my family.
"Hi Kansas,I'm sorry to hear about your situation. It seems like you have many options of where to go, but you mention that you're not close to your family, so that leaves out some people. Is there anyone you can talk to? It's important to find someone you can trust and confide in. If you are not close with your family, maybe you can find a friend or a family member who lives in another city. Having a teenaged friend who you can talk to might be helpful. That's because they are often less likely to judge you if you say you can't talk to a family member. But you could also talk to a school counsellor, teacher, or a social worker. I hope you find a place to go. It sounds like you have a problem that you can't fix by yourself, but there are people who can help. Good luck!

I'm having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her. How can I learn how to listen and get myself together?
"The problem with listening is that most people don't really know how to do it. They may know what they want to say, but they don't know how to say it in a way that will make sense to the other person and which will trigger what they need to hear. A good teacher is always needed.Since you are the one having the problem, I'm going to assume that the person you're trying to help is the one who is doing something that is not very good for your relationship. If this is the case, you may be able to help your girlfriend by identifying what her bad behavior is. If you're able to tell her something that she wants to hear, but doesn't know how to say, then you can at least point out to her that there is a difference between good listening and bad listening.I would not recommend that you try and teach her how to listen. Try and get her the help she needs first. Good luck."Mental health is not a sign of weakness."If you are struggling with depression, for example, talk to your doctor or a counselor. Medication can really help and it doesn't have to mean that you've lost your strength."It's not your fault."If you have been together for a while and this particular problem has always been present, then I might have a different answer. It is possible that what she is doing is her way of communicating to you that she wants to end the relationship. However, keep in mind that many people say ""yes"" because they want to please the other person."You can always change."I would not suggest that you change. We are stuck with who we are and can't change who we love. However, you can learn new ways to respond to her. If you don't want to change, then don't change. If you do want to change, then you need to find a way that feels good to you."It's more important to understand yourself than her."If you have been together for a while, then I might suggest that this particular problem may be showing up more often because you haven't quite figured out what you want. Being in a relationship is hard enough without having to figure out what you want all of the time. My hope is that you will figure it out soon."I can't answer whether or not you will be happy with your choice."I can answer that it's impossible to know that before you do it.

I'm a male in my early 20s. Lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. I then start to act weird because I'm trying to fight my paranoia. This leads to people starring at me because they don't know that I'm suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. They just notice me acting scared around kids and they think I'm a threat because of it. I'm not a pervert or predator. I would never hurt a kid.

My boyfriend and I have a terrible sex life after three years of dating, and I don't know what to do. I have this lingering fear of pain during sex after having two partners previously who weren't careful. How can I stop projecting this onto my current boyfriend?
Hi, I'm sorry this is happening to you. I would think about what in your past relationships contributes to this fear. You may be feeling that you can't trust this person to be gentle, or you may feel your past partners were not really into you. You may want to explore these ideas with a therapist. One thing I would try is to have sex without a condom. Use a diaphragm if you have one. That way, if it does hurt a bit, you will know it is your body's response and not fear. This fear can really affect your desire to have sex, so making yourself approachable to your own body can help. Also, being able to talk about what you like and don't like during sex can help with this. All of this sounds more complicated than I have here, but it can help to have a therapist help you explore this further. Good luck!

He's lied about his past/present situations. Since time has passed, he has changed, but I still have my doubts. I have no idea if I should stay or go, but I hate this feeling. I don't trust him all too much, but yet he hasn't done anything for me not to trust him recently.
Trust is essential for any relationship and if you do not trust your partner this may be a strong reason to end the relationship.There are ways to increase your trust in your partner.You can ask questions about his past and present life to find out more about him.If you feel hesitant about trusting him, then tell him what you expect of him in terms of trust.If he does not meet your expectations, then you can end the relationship.If he does meet your expectations, then you will have more trust in the relationship.Ask yourself why you are hesitant to trust him and what you expect from him to increase your trust in him.Maybe you expect that he would cheat on you or tell you something that may be untrue.Without knowing your reasons, then it is difficult to tell you what to do.Do you want to stay in the relationship or not?This is your decision and only you can know if staying in the relationship is right for you and your partner.Start by having open discussions with your partner about your feelings and expectations. With this, you will feel more secure in your partner and your feelings of trust. You may also decide together to either stay together or not. This discussion may feel difficult or even stressful at first. You will both learn more about each other and your relationship by having these discussions. This is not easy, but it is necessary. With these discussions and learning more about each other, then you will have a better sense of trust in the relationship.Warm wishes to both of you!

I was never single, afraid to be alone, and I looked for my boyfriend to make me happy. I finally worked on my self, was in a relationship, and I did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didn't work out. Now months later, no man peaks my interest. Am I ready to date again? Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?
"Hi Seattle, The most important thing is to accept that relationships and love just doesn't work out all the time. It's okay to be heartbroken and to grieve the loss. You may have outgrown the relationships in your past. I'm sure you can understand that now that you've had time to see the bad parts of relationships and heal from the wounds.I agree that it's possible that no man peaked your interest because there were no ""spark"". Maybe you weren't ready to date again. It's also possible that you're over a year out of the relationship, and if you date someone new again, you'll go through all the painful memories again, and it will be too much.I'm impressed with how much you've changed and that you've worked on your self. I'm not sure what you mean when you say you ""looked for a boyfriend to make me happy"", but you may have been looking for someone who wasn't going to make you happy. If you're not happy and he's not good for you, you're going to end up heartbroken. It's good that you're not afraid to be alone now. It's true that we can get used to being alone and can start missing the companionship and love. Try not to look for a boyfriend too quickly. If you're not ready to date and you're not really missing dating, maybe you're in the right place right now.I agree that if you're in a place where no one sparks your interest and you're not ready to date again, it's okay to hold off. You're a smart, mature woman. Give yourself permission to be in the place where you are right now. You're healing. You're ready. We're all in this place at different stages in our lives.I wish you the best.""Love is just a four-letter word.""The one who does not love does not hurt, nor does the one who is hurting.""Be careful about reading meaning into love!

"Can a counselor take sides with one parent and allow a parent to order the child to tell the counselor ""every detail"" about what happened during the other parent’s visitation in order to help build a case for child custody?"
I don't think a therapist would take sides with a parent and allow them to order the child to tell the therapist ""every detail"" about what happened during the other parent's visitation. I do think that a therapist would encourage the child to speak to them if they felt it would help in the child's healing process. In fact, the therapist might even suggest that the child do so.As a general rule, therapists do not participate in custody proceedings. In order to be able to provide the best support and care to a child, a therapist should not be getting involved in the process in any way. Even if the therapist was asked to assist in court proceedings, they would still be bound by the Code of Ethics and refuse to act in a way that conflicted with their Code of Ethics. If a child is being abused, a therapist may become involved in helping to protect the child from further harm, regardless of who the alleged perpetrator is. This is especially important if the therapist has any concerns about the competence of one parent in caring for the child. I'm not saying that this would be the case here, but I think it's worth noting that a therapist could intervene in this situation.I'm not sure how this question is being asked, but it seems like there are some other aspects that need to be considered as well. I wonder what your questions are?

I feel angry, anxious, and depressed. The PTSD I suffer is from a past relationship.
"I agree with the other answers here, and will add one thing: One of the best ways to work with any traumatic or traumatic experiences that you have had is through meditation. In meditation, you sit with the discomfort of a traumatic experience and allow it to be present with you, but not overwhelming you. Then, you learn to observe the experiences and sensations as if you were an outside observer, detached from the experience. You would be able to do this through meditation. Once you learn to be an outside observer, you can then work on your feelings about the event and what you are going through now. Even if you have no memory of the traumatic experience, the distress of it can affect you in many ways. And, now, if you have never dealt with that event directly, your brain is likely to ""react"" to that experience in the future by reminding you of it in future situations. In order for this to be resolved, you need to be able to bring awareness to the event and understand it on an emotional level, which allows you to have a new understanding of what it meant to you, and helps you feel more at ease. The result of this would be a sense of peace. I would recommend a trauma therapist who uses mindfulness and exposure therapy to help with this. Best of luck!

I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.  I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.

He wants to wear makeup and heels. He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. I have tried this for him, but I don’t like it and have told him so. He keeps making comments about it and says he can't live without it.

I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac. I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years. I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?
It is very important to address all of your issues in therapy. Counseling can help you to find the balance between your needs and your feelings. You may need to talk with a therapist about specific areas of your life that you need to work on, or about specific life events that you are experiencing. It is important to work with a therapist who is experienced in helping you live your life to the fullest. You can also ask for referrals to other therapists in your area. You can also ask your family for support. It is so important to find the right therapist for you. Best of luck!

"My boyfriend and I have been together for five years now. Throughout the entire first day that we met, he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. That same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom's acknowledgment) and we kissed. The next two days were a repetition of the first day. On the third night, my mother finally caught us, and I was kicked out of my house. I left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. It was very hard for us. His stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot. Our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. After that, it was a downward spiral. We were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. We kept having the famous ""you're doing it wrong—do it this way"" argument. After six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. One afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. He told me to let him leave or he would hit me. He had once promised he would never touch me, so I challenged him to do it. He slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. I haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. I don't live with him, I don't depend on him, and we don't have children. We both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. He always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. Now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how I don't ever make the effort to try to be okay. I've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. I know he has to change that on his own. I just want to know if there's people who have gone through this and had the tables turned? Is there hope for a better future together?"

I'm a teenage girl, and my dad is an alcoholic. I hate being at home with him because he just stresses me out. He can be picking me up from basketball practice or piano lessons, and half of the time, I don't even know if he's sober or not. I refuse to get into the vehicle with him and walk home sometimes. I've either been barely sleeping or I over sleep, so I'm always tired. I live in a small town, so there's no one I can really talk to because I'm not really that close with my family.

I'm a male in my early 20s. Lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. I then start to act weird because I'm trying to fight my paranoia. This leads to people starring at me because they don't know that I'm suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. They just notice me acting scared around kids and they think I'm a threat because of it. I'm not a pervert or predator. I would never hurt a kid. I like kids and don't know why I'm so scared to be around them. I don't understand why I feel like this. Am I a bad person? How do I make this stop?

I'm sorry to hear that you are feeling this way. PTSD is a complex medical condition that can be caused by a variety of traumatic events. It can also be the result of a life event such as a car accident, a suicide attempt, or a violent incident. There are many different ways that PTSD can develop and it can be difficult to pinpoint the specific event that caused you to experience these symptoms. I would encourage you to talk with your doctor about any medications you are taking, talk with your therapist, and seek the help of a qualified mental health professional if you have questions about your symptoms. Best of luck to you and your family!

i’ve been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for just over a year. this past week she admitted to me that she has feelings for another guy. she says it’s “just a crush” but i don't know how to cope with it. how should i deal with this?
"i can only imagine how hard that must have been to hear. on one hand, most of us would say we want our partners to always be honest with us, but on the other disclosures like this can lead to feelings of worry and inadequacy if were not careful. so let me first of all say that it is very normal for human beings, even very committed and happy partners to have moments where they notice an attraction for someone else. quite honestly, the brain can't help it. it sees something good looking and it pays attention.

i would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.
"take one day at a time!!! each day do things that make you happy, moves to a positive place, focusing on the future, give you a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment. journal at the end of the day of how well you did that day in focusing on these things. each day should be a step better than the previous day. you will have days that you didn't do as well....that is human and ok. just get back on track the next day....at the end of the week, review how well you did and give your self a grade.

"hi brookfield, it can be unsettling to see a relationship turn into a ""deal breakers"" situation. you have realized that people comment a lot...they say things like ""you look [in a kindly way] - you type a bunch...you flirt a lot...you say something cute...you say you just want to be different...you're not going to look like that...you're not going to say as much- you just want to be happy. if he says anything to make you feel better..."" or gets cranky, if he says something and you bothered and sk and start doing something hurtful...i don't think that just because it hurts, but it makes me think:- if this is really hurting then maybe he is truly not so sweet of guy comments anymore...sokay, what hurtful is that? if this is really hurtful, i think maybe he doesn't feel valued...bviously connected to that. in fact, if this is a sy he is feeling loved or important...i would suggest talking about the importance of having more kss, like having some type of time (likely a hobby).

i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky. is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?
"thank you for your question. its completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session. many people report having felt this way. i can't say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session. for many people, it can take weeks, months, or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session.

there are issues from my past that have me very heavily burdened in my heart. ive been torn for so many years and i need help so i can move on with my life. i experienced trauma when i was 8 years old and i did come out about it until i was 40. now i know this is what's holding me back on my happiness. i've met a very loving and caring man but because im holding on to these things from my past i’m pushing him away. how can i get my life back?
"hi cross country closeness, i have several good points. i am sorry that this has been so up close and personal. you have made a big mistake that you can't escape it. break the habit, i would recommend seeing a ""psychiatr"" like ""medicine"" . a medical professional can help you to get over the ""currrrr"" label.

"one of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! it is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. while your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. they are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. i would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard.

"depending on your own sexual history and what you grew up expecting to be ""normal"" in the bedroom, i can easily imagine that this came as quite a shock to you! it doesnt necessarily mean, however that your husband is: gay, bisexual transgender, or even necessarily a cross-dresser etc. unless he has already told you so. i agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you. that being said, what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on isn't always what we identify as.

"hi there,i first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal. studies have been done that show that 80% of human thoughts are ""negative"" so you are not alone. i like to think of thoughts as a tornado... if you are in a tornado, you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial. however, when you are, lets say, a mile away from a tornado, it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe. when unhelpful or scary thoughts arise, we tend to start a ""war"" with them, which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado.

"thank you for sharing your question. i imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session. i would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals. for example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1. ""i will learn about the effects of medication on the symptoms of depression and anxiety.""2.

"it sounds like you are having some pretty severe depression. depression can cause insomnia, and make a person focus on their own perceptions that they are ""worthless"". it is important to remember that other people may not truly perceive you as worthless. this is the depression talking. i think that it is extremely important when you are this depressed, to sit down and write down some positives about yourself.

"my boyfriend and i have been together for five years now. throughout the entire first day that we met, he and i had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. that same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my moms acknowledgment) and we kissed. the next two days were a repetition of the first day. on the third night, my mother finally caught us, and i was kicked out of my house. i left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. it was very hard for us. his stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. i quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. there were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a walmart parking lot. our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. after that, it was a downward spiral. we were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. we kept having the famous ""you're doing it wrong—do it this way"" argument. after six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. one afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. i was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. he told me to let him leave or he would hit me. he had once promised he would never touch me, so i challenged him to do it. he slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. i haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. i don't live with him, i don't depend on him, and we don't have children. we both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. he always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how i don't ever make the effort to try to be okay. i've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. i know he has to change that on his own. i just want to know if theres people who have gone through this and had the tables turned? is there hope for a better future together?"
"hi cleveland, i feel your pain. it's been very difficult to live your life at one point, and your mother must understand that. i know you say that you have ""done nothing wrong"", but you don't have the power to change him. you know you don't want this to happen, but the fact that you asked him to re-experiect your emotions and come to agreement that it doesn't, and that's appropriate, given the other dynamics. ""i'm alright now"" to stay with my dad, and i know that.

i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. i was very embarrassed.
"i also want to note that we, as a society, are especially judgemental about how women dress and present themselves. i am sorry that this boy said something insensitive. there is nothing shameful about your body and it was not your intention to ""display everything."" it also wasnt his place to judge you. as women we are expected to be sexy in some situations and demure in others.

i always feel like im doing something wrong. everything i do is crappy. i want to cry all the time. i cant eat or sleep.
"cracking is normal. its ok to feel down when it's too late. its time to find the right time, right place, and make-up. i'm a sucker for feeling down and dirty; when you're a studio-bound student trying to find the ""crying all the time"" phase, i always feel like i was doing something wrong, but look at the bigger picture. look at the big picture.

i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky. is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?
"thank you for your question. its completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session. many people report having felt this way. i can't say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session. for many people, it can take weeks, months, or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session.

im a teenage girl, and my dad is an alcoholic. i hate being at home with him because he just stresses me out. he can be picking me up from basketball practice or piano lessons, and half of the time, i don't even know if he's sober or not. i refuse to get into the vehicle with him and walk home sometimes. i've either been barely sleeping or i over sleep, so i'm always tired. i live in a small town, so there's no one i can really talk to because im not really that close with my family.
"i sympathize with what you describe. it sounds like there's been a lot of stress on your own in the past few years with you regarding your father's addiction. it's tough not to have experienced some form of stress reduction during your growing up years, but it's different at different times. i think that it's great that you are willing to seek help from a therapist who understands the dynamics of addiction. you may also want to consider looking for a bead light in your home to turn, asking the neighbors and general public that your parents appreciate the home environment and feel safe again.

i'm having relationship problems and i want to fix them to make things right before i lose her. how can i learn how to listen and get myself together?
"the best tool for becoming a better listener that i know of is called imago dialogue. it consists of 3 steps:1. mirroring what she says (without judging, commenting, refuting, defending, arguing, or scoffing--just listening, no matter the content) and repeating it back, word-for-word. continue to ask if she has more to add until she doesnt.2. validating. you tell her you you understanding why she feels this way.

i never get infections or scars or anything, and it doesnt bother me if it gets filled up with blood or something, but im concerned.
"hi renatge, this cant be, but i can tell you that it would be helpful to see a plastic surgeon who is highly skilled in viscoting wounds to help identify areas of infection and/or scar tissue. sometimes there are ""holes"" in the top of the body that people experience, and these could be in their bodies as ""scars"" or "'colds''" (not arteries) or "'colds'). infection or scars are a good and healthy and healthy scar (not infection, but more scar tissue) treatment. it is very common to find a doctor that has the field training in venesections (for scar tissue) and/or surgery. if theres no scar tissue (and/or scar tissue, or scar tissue, etc.

im scared that i am with this man so i wont be alone. he should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case, and i don’t want to hurt him.
"thanks for reaching out. this is a tough situation. it would be my understanding that you are very hesitant to leave this man. i don't know how old this man is, but i can tell you that if he is worth more to you than him, and i don't want to hurt him either. however, i can also understand how unsure he is about being with someone.

im a male in my early 20s. lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. i then start to act weird because i'm trying to fight my paranoia. this leads to people starring at me because they don't know that i'm suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. they just notice me acting scared around kids and they think i'm a threat because of it. i'm not a pervert or predator. i would never hurt a kid. i like kids and don't know why i'm so scared to be around them. i dont understand why i feel like this. am i a bad person? how do i make this stop?
"in our practice, many people we see have unwanted thoughts of doing harm to children - physically or sexually. as you said, these are intrusive and unwanted thoughts - not genuine desires to harm them. this is a form of ocd we often call harm or pedophilic ocd. what you are describing here as ""paranoia"" sounds similar to this, and is so demoralizing because you are dealing both with the distress of these unwanted thoughts and feelings, as well as the fear and uncertainty about your own character as a good person.if this is really what is going on (further assessment by the right professional would determine this), the current gold standard approach to addressing ocd is exposure with response prevention - in this case, confronting the feared situations, thoughts or images on purpose, rather than avoiding them, until they lose the fear and shame associated with them."" this is a coping response to the threat.

is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?
"yes, it is normal to cry during therapy, it is a time of catharsis, letting things out, shedding our skin, dropping our weights and just to let you know, even therapists sometimes feel like crying in sessions. although people often cry or become upset, it is in no way a measure of ""good therapy"". c"s come in many forms, and there is no measurement that we can use to measure emotions. although people are people, and crying is a form of cathars tears, no guarantees, just a measure to make sure you are 100% sure your ""complain,"" also very likely carries some measure of tissues and other things. not all of usday thing we need to cry.

my boyfriend and i have a terrible sex life after three years of dating, and i dont know what to do. i have this lingering fear of pain during sex after having two partners previously who werent careful. how can i stop projecting this onto my current boyfriend?
"thanks for reaching out. this is a great question and i am very glad you wrote it, it'sounded like you have some great sex experience with your current boyfriend. there are usually a few of us who have this lingering fear of pain, ""what if we did really badly?"" or maybe it was something about a previous relationship that didnt get the heat of the moment. i am going to assume that you have a very bad sex experience and this sex experience is not a good sex - if you have done this, you will not be hurt at all; if you were really terrible at sex if you really sex, then the lingering fear will quickly linger, ""weaksex"" that's just a terrible experience, and then you will no longer be a bad or terrible sexual experience again.

hes lied about his past/present situations. since time has passed, he has changed, but i still have my doubts. i have no idea if i should stay or go, but i hate this feeling. i don't trust him all too much, but yet he hasnt done anything for me not to trust him recently.
"i can't say that you have absolute ""no"" decisions to make, but i will say that you have major options. you can decide to stay or go. i would not hesitate for long (unless you absolutely, like me, hate him) if i could help you sort this out. for one thing, i can tell you have options. you can ask him about his communication style, tell him your reasons for staying.

i was never single, afraid to be alone, and i looked for my boyfriend to make me happy. i finally worked on my self, was in a relationship, and i did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didn't work out. now months later, no man peaks my interest. am i ready to date again? is there a reason no one sparks my interest?
"hi pocahontas, im sorry you had this intense feeling of wanting to be with someone, and now no one is watching.i wonder if the pressure of ""getting someone to make you happy"" has now lifted from you? oh, and relationships can present some challenges (if they do overlap, and/or you suddenly feel more attractive, not less so, because dating a healthy, single, successful person is something you will probably enjoy and look forward to doing.) and maybe even a few things, if you're a single, maybe paired up and made some mistakes because now you're not quite sure you'd like someone who cares about you. having said that, what i would say to someone, is that they have learned about themselves and had doubts about what they would have liked from hearing about that. and, having a partner who cares about others, is a huge advantage to a relationship.

"can a counselor take sides with one parent and allow a parent to order the child to tell the counselor ""every detail"" about what happened during the other parent’s visitation in order to help build a case for child custody?"
"hello. i can't really make you do anything ""no"" but many clients do. the best thing for them is for them to be able to tell the parents in writing what they can (as the parent or a legal guardian could) about what happened (i.e., ask the parent to order an oral recount during a custody hearing, etc.). you can have the parent write out their ""every detail"" because that can be extremely difficult to do. and, if it is not something that they wrote down for what the parents can and can and should be done by the parents.

every winter i find myself getting sad because of the weather. how can i fight this?
"thank you for sharing. it seems like since the ""winter blues"" happens to you every year it may also be impacting your quality of life and possibly relationships. what you report sounds like you may be experiencing seasonal affective disorder (sad) and is quite common to many from about fall thru winter seasons; but, also can impact folks during the spring and summer months.the best care and treatment for sad includes discussing it with your pcp (primary care physician), integrating light therapy (full-spectrum lighting) throughout home and workplace (where possible), psychotherapy, and possibly medications (e.g. wellbutrin xl, aplenzin).be sure to exercise good self-care and checkout the mayo clinic's website for sad here: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/basics/definition/con-20021047."" perhaps you focus on these core issues when we can not really focus on a certain area or problem.one thing that i would suggest is a specific book you can read, ""the winter wonders of the winter season.""

im having a quinceañera, and the girls don't like their dresses. they never told me, and now it's a week away. i dont know what to do.
"hello. this is a tricky situation and it is usually the case that the person is unaware of their quincesality and how they feel about their dresses. the person may be in the midst of a difficult decision and these girls, who were both affianced and had a great time, but the relationship dynamics are different. some people are actually very clear with their reasons for quitting. it just takes a village of people to make this happen.
