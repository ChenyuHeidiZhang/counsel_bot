Any time my family and friends are in an altercation, I’m the one who steps in. I’m the one they call to fight for them. I do this even though I have a tough time trusting the people I’m fighting for.
I am so sorry you are experiencing this situation. Considering that you mentioned not having a place to go, it may be best to address the problem as oppose to “just take all of it”. Confrontation can be done in a healthy and effective way.

I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago.
I'm sorry, but I don

I terminated my counseling relationship with a social worker several years ago. I am now realizing that I would like to begin counseling again. The social worker’s voicemail message says that he returns calls in 24 hours, but he hasn't called me back.
I would recommend

I have three siblings. My mom loves them and not me. She’s always yelling at me, but when it comes to my siblings, she talks to them.
I'm not sure how to respond to this. I'm not sure if you're saying that you're not going to be able to trust me or if you're saying that you're not going to be able to trust your siblings. I'm not sure what you're saying.
=== 5 ===
I need answers to my anger, possessiveness, and urges. I am angry all the time. I push people away so much that I actually blow up on people now because they ask me how my day is or was.
You are not angry.
=== 6 ===
I had a dispute with my therapist regarding an appointment cancellation. Now, she is blocking me from seeing other psychologists at the same clinic (which takes my insurance), which is also where I get my psychiatric services. There is a strict 48 hour cancellation policy, and my appointments are at 3:00 on Tuesday.
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm not sure how to proceed. I'm not sure if you can continue to work with him. I'm not sure if you can continue to work with him because of the issues you have with him.
=== 7 ===
What do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parent's custody visitation?
I have been in therapy for over a year and a half and have been able to get my son back.
=== 8 ===
I've recently thought that i could be transgender but I've never had the mind of a girl.

=== 9 ===
I think I have depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and I have anger issues. I told my mom over and over again. She told me she would get me a therapist, but she never did.
I think you are right.
=== 10 ===
I have been noticing myself really enjoying watching/reading about gay or lesbian couples. I've also been imagining what it might be like to date a girl, and I like the idea. I also find guys cute too.
I think you are right.
=== 11 ===
I started dating a guy I met online. He told me that he registered sex offender but he didn't do anything. He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years.
I suggest that you talk to your partner about this. You can also talk to your friend about this.
=== 12 ===
I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?
You are not alone. Many people have experienced similar feelings. You may want to talk to your therapist about what you are experiencing.
=== 13 ===
The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.
I'm glad you are feeling better.
=== 14 ===
Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?
It is normal for people to cry during therapy. It is not a sign of weakness or weakness of the client. It is a sign of the client's need to be heard.
=== 15 ===
After 40 years of being straight, how could I now find myself interested in people of the same sex? I have had a few same sex encounters of my own doing.
It is important to remember that you are not the only one who has had a same sex encounter.
=== 16 ===
I'm a girl, and I can't tell whether I'm bisexual or gay. I like girls a little more than boys, but I don't really know.
I'm a woman, and I'm not sure if I'm bisexual or gay.
=== 17 ===
I found out my boyfriend takes anti-depression medicine. Lately he's been saying he has a lot on his mind, and he needs time to think about us. We've only been dating 3 weeks but I like him a lot.
No, it does not necessarily. Your sexual preference is based on who you ARE attracted to, not what does not turn you on. If you find you have no sex drive at all, this is called asexual.

I am sorry to hear that. I am not sure how to proceed. I am not sure if you have a specific plan for dealing with this. I would suggest that you contact your insurance company and ask them to cancel your insurance.

I am a heterosexual male in my late 20s. I find myself wearing pantyhose, heels, skirts and other women's clothing in private. I am torn on how to feel about it.

I was born a girl, but I want to be a boy. Because of my religion I can't tell my family. I know they won't accept me. What do I do?
You're not a boy.

Something happened this summer that I cannot forgive myself for. When I think about what happened, I feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.
I'm sorry for what happened.

My suppose-to-be father told me to go find my real dad. We haven't been getting along since I was a teenager. If I said one thing that he thought was wrong, I always got degraded. He never said “I love you.” He never gave us hugs. He’s always called me horrible names.
I know that you are not a therapist, but I would like to ask you a question. What is the best way to deal with intrusive thoughts?
=== 4 ===
I am in my mid 30s. I feel I have used only 5% of my potential. I am in film making, but everything is stuck. I've never had a serious relationship. I had worthless jobs.

Recently my boyfriend broke up with me because of my bad language. But he thinks I'm a total b***h. I know I'm bipolar and can be selfish. He called me today and says he can't go through with the breakup. I was broken and didn't want a breakup to begin with, but I know I'm horrible at times and can't help it. It's like I'm battling myself.
I think it's important to have a conversation about how you feel about your feelings and how you feel about your partner. You can talk about how you feel about your feelings and how you feel about your partner. You can talk about how you feel about your feelings and how you feel about your partner.

I have three children. The oldest is nine and not my biological child. The middle child is three and the youngest is one. I have a great relationship with the oldest two children but I haven't developed the same level of attatchment to the youngest child. I rarely want her around and look forward to her nap times.
Hi Lockport, Building a relationship when there are already children involved is very tricky. You don't tell us whether you live together or not.

She refuses to talk to me and told my mom (her grand mother) that she is remembering things from the past. I don't know what to do. My daughter blames me and swears she hates me. My parents say I should just let my daughter live with her dad, but I don't see how I could fix things if I only see her every other weekend. What should I do?

My girlfriend broke up with me five months ago because I said awful things to her one night for no reason of hers. I have been trying to get her back, but it isn’t easy. She is in her 50s and I am in my 40s. She is the one I want for my life, and this is killing me. Every day, I cry, and I am desperate for help.
What do you do?

I am always arguing with my father. He gets stressed over work and health and talks to me in a tone of voice that seems very demanding and seems more like yelling. I get upset often at this. Am I too sensitive? He always says I am overreacting but never seems to understand that he is hurting my feelings.
Do you think that you are overreacting?
=== 11 ===
My boyfriend says I'm nuts. I need to get help because I get an overwhelming feeling that he is cheating on me. Whenever I try to talk with him about it, he always turns it around on me by telling me what I'm doing wrong. I know that accusing him does not help. When his whole demeanor shifts towards me, I can't help but think that something is wrong.
I know that you are not the only one who feels this way.
=== 12 ===
My boyfriend and I have a terrible sex life after three years of dating, and I don't know what to do. I have this lingering fear of pain during sex after having two partners previously who weren't careful. How can I stop projecting this onto my current boyfriend?

For the past year, I have been feeling pressured to do well in school, and it put a ton of stress on me.

My dad beat and mentally abused me so badly that I can't function properly. Letting go of the past is important to moving on and getting better, but I’m terrified to get better because I don't even know who I am without the trauma. I've never gotten to be myself. I don't even know who I am.
There are many types of traumas, and they certainly can compound on one another as you experience them.

Maybe this is a stupid question, but I sometimes don't know what's real or not. If feel at times like everyone's lying. How do I know if God is one of those lies?
I'm sorry you are feeling like you don't know what's real or not. It sounds like you are struggling with a lot of emotional turmoil. It is normal to have doubts and to ask difficult questions. You should try to find a counselor who can help you explore these doubts and feelings. You can also consider talking to a faith counselor or priest to get guidance.

My therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here. However, my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends. I have loaned money to him many times, and he always paid me back. I had a medical emergency last weekend and I was heavily medicated. I knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me, but this therapist dropped me off and never came again.
Hello. You have raised some very valid concerns in regards to your therapist's behavior. If you are not comfortable with this therapist, then you should find another one. You should also be cautious about who you allow into your personal life, as they may not be someone you would want to disclose important personal information to.

I was in a relationship with a woman for four years. We both made mistakes, but I do love her. She has moved in with another lady. I think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her. How can I find out for sure?
It is difficult to know what is going on in someone else's mind. It sounds like you may be feeling a range of emotions, some of which may be confusing and difficult to understand. First, it may be helpful to talk to her directly and ask her what is going on. If she is unwilling or unable to talk to you, it may be worth considering whether continuing to invest your time and energy into this relationship is something that is ultimately worth it.

I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.
It sounds like you are feeling lost and alone.Often when we feel lost, we start to look for others who can fill the space that we feel is missing.Sadly, many times these people turn out to be disappointing and irrelevant.In order to find your own voice, it is important to start by listening to yourself.Notice what you are feeling, thinking and doing in your own life.Once you have a better understanding of who you are, you can start to find your way back.

My spouse decided he no longer wanted me six years ago. Things have deteriorated so badly that we have separated but still live in the same house. He says he despises the sight of me, wants to be with other women, and divorce. What I don't understand is that he says constantly that I have no feelings for him and gets absurdly jealous if I speak to another male. Why does he constantly do these behaviors?
Hi, I don't know what to say. These are really difficult questions and I wish I had more answers for you. From what you have said, it sounds like your husband may be feeling a lot of intense anger and resentment towards you. I'm sorry that you are going through this. It sounds like he might be engaging in destructive behaviours (e.g. making threats of divorce, trying to control your life, isolating you from your friends and family) as a way to cope with his feelings.

I just lost my grandpa and i'm having a rough time with it. I need some help to deal with the loss, but I don’t think I can pay for counseling. Where Can I get help?

I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental. I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?
I understand that quitting smoking can be difficult, but it is important that you work towards that goal. I would recommend finding an addiction counselor who specializes in smoking cessation. They can help you to develop a plan and support you through the process.

My brother has been a heroin addict for years, and he’s now in his mid-30s. He has taken from me my mom and my grandparents. He's sick in the head. Now he moved his girlfriend into the house because they both manipulated us. Today, my mom and my brother went toe-to-toe over his girlfriend not helping around the house and always being high.
It sounds like there is a lot of tension in this household. It's understandable that your mom would feel frustrated, and your brother may feel threatened by her. It's important to have a safe place to talk about how you're feeling. You could reach out to a counselor or therapist to help you work through these emotions.

I feel like I was born in the wrong body I feel like I should be a girl not a boy  Ever since I was young, I have wanted to be a girl. I felt like what I was wasn’t me. I want to know what I can do about it. My family is against transgender people and don't want anything to do with them. I want to be “me.” I feel as if I'll be happy then.
I understand how you feel. It can be really difficult to come out to your family and tell them that you want to transition. They might not be supportive and might not want anything to do with you. It is important to remember that you are allowed to be you and that you deserve to be happy. You can find support through transgender organizations or by talking to a counselor.

I have bipolar II disorder, I'm addicted to alcohol and weed, and I'm hopeless. I keep drinking even though it's harming myself and others.
Hi, and thanks for reaching out. It sounds like you are struggling a lot and it's tough when we feel like we can't control our lives. Alcohol and other drugs can play a big role in our bipolar disorder and addictions. When we drink or use drugs, we are often looking for a way to deal with the emotional pain we are feeling.It can be really hard to admit that we need help and that we need to stop drinking and using drugs. When we are battling addiction, it can be hard to make the decision to get help. There are a lot of resources out there, like Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous, and it may be helpful to talk to someone about your situation. It's really important that you don't give up on yourself. You are worth it.

On the first day of school I wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like I had bigger boobs. I did that the whole school year and my parents never found out. But now I can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest. How do I fix this?
It sounds like you're feeling ashamed of your body and worried about what your friends and family might think. Your anxiety is likely stemming from the fact that you feel like you're not good enough. You need to start by accepting yourself for who you are and what you have. You're not the only person in the world who has boobs and you're not the only person who has a body. You should be proud of your body and your boobs. You should also be proud of the fact that you're able to be comfortable in your own skin. You can start by hanging out with your friends and family without worrying about what anyone might see. You should also be honest with them about what's going on and tell them that you're insecure about your body. They'll be supportive and understanding.

I'm a female in my mid 20s. Lately I tend to over drink and I've become a very angry drunk. In the past, I have even cheated on my boyfriend while I was under the influence of alcohol. But now, even if I don't do anything wrong and don't embarrass myself, I still feel really guilty after a night of drinking. I don't understand why I'm feeling this way.
Alcohol can increase feelings of guilt, shame, and remorse. It's important to remember that these emotions are normal and are a result of the drinking. It's also important to remember that alcohol doesn't make the bad decisions you made any better. It's important to seek help and talk to someone about your drinking, so you can learn how to manage it in a healthy way.

I know that I need to get past my feelings for this person I fell in love with, but t's so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings I've never felt before. I feel like I don't want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, I know I need to be without him. I can't discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered "wrong" by a lot of people. How can I get myself to just move on?
It sounds like you are feeling a lot of conflicting emotions. It can be difficult to move on when we have strong feelings for someone, but we need to do what is best for ourselves. Here are a few things to think about and consider: 1. What is the reason you fell in love with this person? Was it based on qualities that you found attractive, or was it because of some other reason? 2. What are your thoughts about the conditions of your love? Are they acceptable to you? 3. How do you feel about staying in a relationship where the conditions are not met? Are you willing to put up with those conditions? 4. What do you think would be best for you in the long run? Do you think it is possible to move on and be happy in a different situation? 5. Are you willing to talk about this with somebody? A therapist can help you work through these difficult feelings and make a decision that is best for you.

The past always feels much brighter and more beautiful than my present. Everything about what's gone feels so amazing; almost like I'm high off nostalgia. But in the end it just makes me feel sadder knowing that all of the memories (and a close friend that left me) are gone forever. How do I move past that and live more in the present?
This is a really difficult question. As somebody who has experienced loss, it is really hard to not focus on the past. I get that you feel like the past is better and that it is all gone, but I think that you need to start by looking at the present. Take some time to reflect on what your present feels like. What are your thoughts? What are your feelings? What are your activities? What are your hobbies? What are your relationships like? Are they healthy? Are they fulfilling? Once you have a good understanding of your present, you can start to think about how to move forward. I think it is really important to remember that the past does not have to be a completely positive experience. It is okay to feel sadness and regret about the past. It is okay to want to remember the good times, but also be okay with letting go of the bad times. In the end, I believe that the most important thing that you can do is to keep moving forward. You will eventually reach a point where you will be able to look back on your past and see it for what it was- a time that you were growing and learning.

I was in a relationship with a woman for four years. We both made mistakes, but I do love her. She has moved in with another lady. I think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her. How can I find out for sure?
It's difficult to know for certain what is going on in another person's heart. However, if you are feeling that she is cheating on you to make you feel closer, it may be a sign to look into your relationship more closely.It is possible that she is feeling neglected and is using this other woman as a way to feel closer to you. This doesn't mean that she doesn't love you, it just means that she is struggling with how she feels about you.Talk to her about your feelings and see if she is willing to talk about the issue more openly. If she is not willing to talk, it may be best to end the relationship.

You deserve to be happy and content in your life.It sounds like you have been struggling for a while and this has taken a toll on you.Talking with someone can be very helpful in exploring the root of the problems and finding solutions.One option is to seek out a therapist. There are many out there and you can find one that is right for you.Talk to your friends, family, or co-workers about whether or not they know of any good resources in the area.Good luck!

What can I do to stop grieving my mother’s death? When I am awake I just cry every day. I don't have anyone to talk to. I need help; I am still cry over her. Will I ever stop crying?
Grieving is a natural and healthy process. It is common to feel sad, lonely, and angry after someone dies. There is no one right way to grieve, and it will vary from person to person. You may find support in a bereavement group or talking with a counselor.

I’ve been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for just over a year. This past week she admitted to me that she has feelings for another guy. She says it’s “just a crush” but I don't know how to cope with it. How should I deal with this?
While difficult, a long distance relationship can provide some difficulties as well. I have to say that many people have been in a long distance relationship and they were not loving at all.Your girlfriend has a crush and she is in the process of knowing what she wants.In the meantime, she wants to be with you.What do you want?Stay true to your wishes and give her space.Do not try to persuade her to come back.Give her time to understand what she wants, who she is and what she is looking for in a relationship.Do not try to rush her.Wait and see how she is doing and if she wants to work on the relationship.From what you write, it sounds as if you care a great deal about her and it is obvious that you are very much in love with her.Trust that she is having her own process and give her time.There is always hope that she will come back.Sending lots of caring energy your way!

I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.
"A lot of times the past holds on to us and we are not completely able to release it. The good news is that we can release it. Releasing is different than denying. Releasing means it is out of your system and you are moving forward. Denial means you are not facing the issue but you are avoiding it. Avoidance is a sign of fear, but fear doesn't have to control you. You can be at peace with your past and move forward into your present and future. You are not a prisoner to your past. With the right tools you can move forward, have peace and build a brighter future. I highly recommend seeking the guidance of a professional therapist. Most places offer free consultation and that is a great time to get all your questions answered. Good luck, you can do this!

I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?
I think it is perfectly normal to feel a little nervous when you go to counseling. Many people feel a lot of anxiety when they go to talk to someone they don't know. Therapy is an opportunity to talk about things that might be difficult to talk about with a stranger. If you feel comfortable with your therapist and things have gone well in the past I wouldn't see it as a problem. However, if you feel like you aren't getting through to your therapist or that you aren't feeling comfortable you might want to find a therapist you do feel comfortable with. This can make a big difference. It can help you to be more open and share your concerns. I hope this was helpful. I wish you the best of luck!

This way you will know that you did the right thing. If you decide to start over, you'll be clear as to what you are willing to offer another person.If you were happy, then congratulations on knowing your own happiness.

I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.  I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.
It's very common for parents to misunderstand and not to 'get' what their kids are saying, because we don't get your language. People need to be educated that LGBTQQ people exist, and there is more to your life than what you have experienced with your parents. The best thing you can do for yourself is seek out a local therapist who specializes in working with LGBTQ issues, and share with your therapist what you are going through. You can trust your therapist to know how best to guide you. You may not want to trust your parents, but at least you can trust a person who has your best interests at heart. I hope that you find the support you need. And that your parents will come to understand what it is like to be undervalued and misunderstood by those they care most about.

Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out. How can I stop these thoughts?
"Hello, and thank you for your question. I have had many people ask me this over the years, and the answer is not simple, because it is a dynamic interaction between thoughts and our belief system. The ""scary thought"" is a thought in your mind that scares you. It could be something that you have seen in the media, on the street, or even something that you have read on the internet. What happens is that when we have an emotion that scares us, our mind has several automatic responses that happen to try and deal with the emotion. Sometimes these responses are things that we ""just don't want to deal with,"" but unfortunately we have to (it's how the human brain works). But here's the thing...we don't really want those things. We really want the emotion to stop, but our brain has not taught us how to stop these automatic responses, so we don't know how to stop them. We can, however, stop them from having power over us. So how do we stop the response? What if we stopped the response and replaced it with something else? You might be asking yourself what you could replace that response with. Your brain knows what it is telling you. It is telling you that the scary thought is a fact, and that ""fact"" is going to happen, so you better believe it!

What has been helpful for you is to communicate your feelings to someone that you trust. This could be a friend, family member, or another adult. If you can find someone that you can talk to about your feelings, it will make it easier for you to express yourself. Although your feelings are tough to experience, being able to talk about them with someone that you trust will help relieve some of the burden. Keep in mind that you may feel a lot of things during this time. It is normal to feel sadness, loneliness, anger, and a lot of other things that you may experience. You may even feel a lot of different emotions at the same time. The best thing you can do is express yourself and keep track of your feelings. It is important to have a record of your emotions so that you can track your emotions as they come and go. This way, you can be aware of what is happening and learn to accept yourself. Remember that you are not alone and that there are a lot of people out there that are feeling the same way that you are feeling. We all experience tough emotions at times and it is okay to talk about how we feel. Now that you have expressed yourself, it is time to reflect and learn from your experiences and how you are feeling. Reflecting on what you learned from the experience can help you cope with your situation. If you learned anything from your experience, you will have a better idea of what to do next time that you may encounter a similar situation. For example, if you learned that you could not handle a situation and it made you feel sad, you could learn to take time to cope with your emotions by talking to someone you trust or by doing something that you enjoy. Although you may be feeling a lot of different emotions, learning to cope with those emotions and accept yourself can help you in the long run. I suggest that you consider seeing a counselor so that you can begin to cope with these emotions in a healthy way. A counselor can provide you with resources and help you learn coping skills that will allow you to deal with your emotions in a healthy and productive way. A counselor can also provide a safe environment for you to discuss your feelings. Remember that it is okay to feel how you feel and that you are not alone. Remember that learning to cope with your emotions is a process.

"My boyfriend and I have been together for five years now. Throughout the entire first day that we met, he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. That same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom's acknowledgment) and we kissed. The next two days were a repetition of the first day. On the third night, my mother finally caught us, and I was kicked out of my house. I left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. It was very hard for us. His stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot. Our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. After that, it was a downward spiral. We were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. We kept having the famous ""you're doing it wrong—do it this way"" argument. After six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. One afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. He told me to let him leave or he would hit me. He had once promised he would never touch me, so I challenged him to do it. He slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. I haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. I don't live with him, I don't depend on him, and we don't have children. We both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. He always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. Now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how I don't ever make the effort to try to be okay. I've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. I know he has to change that on his own. I just want to know if there's people who have gone through this and had the tables turned? Is there hope for a better future together?"

I'm a teenage girl, and my dad is an alcoholic. I hate being at home with him because he just stresses me out. He can be picking me up from basketball practice or piano lessons, and half of the time, I don't even know if he's sober or not. I refuse to get into the vehicle with him and walk home sometimes. I've either been barely sleeping or I over sleep, so I'm always tired. I live in a small town, so there's no one I can really talk to because I'm not really that close with my family.
"Hi Kansas,I'm sorry to hear about your situation. It seems like you have many options of where to go, but you mention that you're not close to your family, so that leaves out some people. Is there anyone you can talk to? It's important to find someone you can trust and confide in. If you are not close with your family, maybe you can find a friend or a family member who lives in another city. Having a teenaged friend who you can talk to might be helpful. That's because they are often less likely to judge you if you say you can't talk to a family member. But you could also talk to a school counsellor, teacher, or a social worker. I hope you find a place to go. It sounds like you have a problem that you can't fix by yourself, but there are people who can help. Good luck!

I'm having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her. How can I learn how to listen and get myself together?
"The problem with listening is that most people don't really know how to do it. They may know what they want to say, but they don't know how to say it in a way that will make sense to the other person and which will trigger what they need to hear. A good teacher is always needed.Since you are the one having the problem, I'm going to assume that the person you're trying to help is the one who is doing something that is not very good for your relationship. If this is the case, you may be able to help your girlfriend by identifying what her bad behavior is. If you're able to tell her something that she wants to hear, but doesn't know how to say, then you can at least point out to her that there is a difference between good listening and bad listening.I would not recommend that you try and teach her how to listen. Try and get her the help she needs first. Good luck."Mental health is not a sign of weakness."If you are struggling with depression, for example, talk to your doctor or a counselor. Medication can really help and it doesn't have to mean that you've lost your strength."It's not your fault."If you have been together for a while and this particular problem has always been present, then I might have a different answer. It is possible that what she is doing is her way of communicating to you that she wants to end the relationship. However, keep in mind that many people say ""yes"" because they want to please the other person."You can always change."I would not suggest that you change. We are stuck with who we are and can't change who we love. However, you can learn new ways to respond to her. If you don't want to change, then don't change. If you do want to change, then you need to find a way that feels good to you."It's more important to understand yourself than her."If you have been together for a while, then I might suggest that this particular problem may be showing up more often because you haven't quite figured out what you want. Being in a relationship is hard enough without having to figure out what you want all of the time. My hope is that you will figure it out soon."I can't answer whether or not you will be happy with your choice."I can answer that it's impossible to know that before you do it.

I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.  I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.

I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac. I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years. I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?
It is very important to address all of your issues in therapy. Counseling can help you to find the balance between your needs and your feelings. You may need to talk with a therapist about specific areas of your life that you need to work on, or about specific life events that you are experiencing. It is important to work with a therapist who is experienced in helping you live your life to the fullest. You can also ask for referrals to other therapists in your area. You can also ask your family for support. It is so important to find the right therapist for you. Best of luck!

"My boyfriend and I have been together for five years now. Throughout the entire first day that we met, he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. That same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom's acknowledgment) and we kissed. The next two days were a repetition of the first day. On the third night, my mother finally caught us, and I was kicked out of my house. I left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. It was very hard for us. His stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot. Our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. After that, it was a downward spiral. We were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. We kept having the famous ""you're doing it wrong—do it this way"" argument. After six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. One afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. He told me to let him leave or he would hit me. He had once promised he would never touch me, so I challenged him to do it. He slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. I haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. I don't live with him, I don't depend on him, and we don't have children. We both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. He always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. Now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how I don't ever make the effort to try to be okay. I've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. I know he has to change that on his own. I just want to know if there's people who have gone through this and had the tables turned? Is there hope for a better future together?"

i’ve been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for just over a year. this past week she admitted to me that she has feelings for another guy. she says it’s “just a crush” but i don't know how to cope with it. how should i deal with this?
"i can only imagine how hard that must have been to hear. on one hand, most of us would say we want our partners to always be honest with us, but on the other disclosures like this can lead to feelings of worry and inadequacy if were not careful. so let me first of all say that it is very normal for human beings, even very committed and happy partners to have moments where they notice an attraction for someone else. quite honestly, the brain can't help it. it sees something good looking and it pays attention.

i would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.
"take one day at a time!!! each day do things that make you happy, moves to a positive place, focusing on the future, give you a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment. journal at the end of the day of how well you did that day in focusing on these things. each day should be a step better than the previous day. you will have days that you didn't do as well....that is human and ok. just get back on track the next day....at the end of the week, review how well you did and give your self a grade.

"hi brookfield, it can be unsettling to see a relationship turn into a ""deal breakers"" situation. you have realized that people comment a lot...they say things like ""you look [in a kindly way] - you type a bunch...you flirt a lot...you say something cute...you say you just want to be different...you're not going to look like that...you're not going to say as much- you just want to be happy. if he says anything to make you feel better..."" or gets cranky, if he says something and you bothered and sk and start doing something hurtful...i don't think that just because it hurts, but it makes me think:- if this is really hurting then maybe he is truly not so sweet of guy comments anymore...sokay, what hurtful is that? if this is really hurtful, i think maybe he doesn't feel valued...bviously connected to that. in fact, if this is a sy he is feeling loved or important...i would suggest talking about the importance of having more kss, like having some type of time (likely a hobby).

"hi cross country closeness, i have several good points. i am sorry that this has been so up close and personal. you have made a big mistake that you can't escape it. break the habit, i would recommend seeing a ""psychiatr"" like ""medicine"" . a medical professional can help you to get over the ""currrrr"" label.

"one of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! it is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. while your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. they are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. i would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard.

"depending on your own sexual history and what you grew up expecting to be ""normal"" in the bedroom, i can easily imagine that this came as quite a shock to you! it doesnt necessarily mean, however that your husband is: gay, bisexual transgender, or even necessarily a cross-dresser etc. unless he has already told you so. i agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you. that being said, what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on isn't always what we identify as.

"thank you for sharing your question. i imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session. i would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals. for example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1.

"it sounds like you are having some pretty severe depression. depression can cause insomnia, and make a person focus on their own perceptions that they are ""worthless"". it is important to remember that other people may not truly perceive you as worthless. this is the depression talking. i think that it is extremely important when you are this depressed, to sit down and write down some positives about yourself.

"i sympathize with what you describe. it sounds like there's been a lot of stress on your own in the past few years with you regarding your father's addiction. it's tough not to have experienced some form of stress reduction during your growing up years, but it's different at different times. i think that it's great that you are willing to seek help from a therapist who understands the dynamics of addiction. you may also want to consider looking for a bead light in your home to turn, asking the neighbors and general public that your parents appreciate the home environment and feel safe again.

Hello, I have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled, insecure, and frustrated during her stay here in the city. I know she comes from a place of love, but she has always been short-fused and highly temperamental if something doesn't work out the way she planned it. I have tried my best to coordinate plans with her, but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication I seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include: inconsiderate, negative, oblivious, and self consumed.

I'm a Christian teenage girl, and I have lost my virginity. My boyfriend is a Christian teenager too, but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner. I planned to abstain from sex but I guess I wasn't clear about this because I was also tempted and led him on. We continued to have sex. Does it mean that he isn't the one God planned for me?
It is important to know that the actions you take in life are not always indicative of your character. Your virginity does not make you less worthy of God's love. You should talk to your boyfriend and share your feelings. You could also consider seeking professional help to help you deal with this situation.

He had a sexual relationship with his sister and kept it from me for years, I confronted about it and he finally told me what happened. But I dont think he is telling me the whole story. He works with her and sees her every day. I feel that I shouldn't stay with him , but he says he ended it long time ago. Should I trust my husband and stay with him?
It sounds as if you have a lot of trust issues. It is understandable to be concerned about what might happen if you leave your husband, but it is also important to weigh the pros and cons of staying in a relationship that has been hurt in this way. It sounds as if you are still in love with your husband and you care about him, so it may be worth trying to work through your trust issues. It would also be helpful to have your husband tell you the full story, including any details about the sexual relationship. After you have had time to process all of this, you can decide what is best for you.

Hi, It sounds like you are struggling with a lot of self- doubts and insecurities. It can be hard to feel confident in our careers or relationships when we feel like we are just starting out. If you are not sure where you want to go with your life, it may be helpful for you to explore your career options more deeply and look for people or organizations that align with your values. Additionally, it is important to remember that no one is perfect, and there is always room for growth and improvement.

Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's important to talk to your doctor about what kind of therapy may be best for you. It's also important to remember that therapy is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and the type of therapy that is best for one person may not be best for another.

Last year, I just always felt hopeless. I don't have a great relationship with my sister. I lost my mother recently, and that really added to my sadness. My sister always brings up how I was never close to my mother.
Your sister is trying to heal her own pain and confusion by pointing out how you were never close to your mother. This is natural and understandable.However, your sister is also trying to be supportive.She may be right that you were never close to your mother, but that doesn't mean you were wrong to care for her.You may need to talk to your sister about your feelings and why you feel so sad and hopeless. Together, you may be able to find a way to work through your grief.

How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?
Thanks for your question. Terminating a counseling relationship can be difficult. There are a few factors that go into it. First, the counselor may have reached a point where they feel that the client is not benefiting from the therapy. Second, the counselor may feel that the client is not meeting their professional obligations, such as keeping sessions on track, following through with homework, or keeping in contact. Finally, the counselor may feel that the relationship is not benefiting either party.

My friend is abusing her prescription medicine. Even though she told me she didn't have any more pills, I found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications.
Hi, I'm sorry to hear that. Prescription abuse is a serious problem that often goes undetected. This is especially true if the person has a history of abusing prescription drugs.If you have concerns about your friend's prescription abuse, I would encourage you to talk to her about it. It's important to have open and honest conversations about any issue that you are concerned about.

I spent my whole life taking care of my dad, but left because of his verbally abusive behavior. I was the only one that helped with his health issues. I feel if I hadn't left he might still be alive. I need help dealing with my grief and guilty conscience.
Wow, you have had a lot of pain in your life. Your leaving was a big decision and it likely created a lot of guilt and grief. I'm glad you are seeking help to deal with those feelings. Counseling can be a great support for you. It's a process where you can talk about your thoughts and feelings and hopefully gain some understanding and insight.

I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental. I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?
I think the first thing that you need to do is to seek professional help. It is difficult to quit smoking and you will need support to do so. Often times individuals are afraid of quitting because they do not know how to do it on their own. A therapist can help you to understand your addiction and provide you with tools to deal with cravings. Additionally, you may want to consider using nicotine replacement therapy such as nicotine gum or patches.

I'm a male in my 20s. My girlfriend is in her late 30s. She's great. She's funny and smart, she has a big heart, and we have an excellent sex life. She recently moved in with me partially because she wanted to and partially because she had no place to go.
Congratulations!You are in an amazing relationship and it sounds like you both have a lot of mutual respect for each other. You are also lucky to have a partner who is open-minded and willing to move in with you. It's important to remember that age is just a number and that you can't judge someone based on their age.You should also make sure that you continue to respect your girlfriend and give her the space she needs. This will help to maintain a healthy relationship.

I feel like I hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes. How can I start accepting myself and be more confident?
Unfortunately, it can be really hard to accept ourselves when we don't feel good about ourselves. One of the first things that you can do is to start recognizing your negative thoughts and replacing them with more positive ones. Once you have a better understanding of your thoughts, you can start to challenge them and start to change your thinking.

The past always feels much brighter and more beautiful than my present. Everything about what's gone feels so amazing; almost like I'm high off nostalgia. But in the end it just makes me feel sadder knowing that all of the memories (and a close friend that left me) are gone forever. How do I move past that and live more in the present?
I understand how you feel. When something we love is taken away, we are overwhelmed with sadness and longing. We remember the good times and we dwell on what we lost. This cycle of grieving creates a sense of detachment from the present.What you need to do is to let go of the past. When you focus on the present, you are able to appreciate the present more. You are also less likely to be overwhelmed by sadness in the future.This is a process that takes time and effort. You might find it helpful to write down your thoughts and feelings about the past. You can also talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these difficult feelings.
=== 17 ===
I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.
This is a difficult question. I think the first step is to be honest with yourself. What are some things that make you feel happy? What do you enjoy doing? What are some of your passions? Once you have a better understanding of who you are, you can start to build relationships with people that reflect this.

I've have lived for sometime with depression but things have gotten a lot better, but why is it so hard to get over anxiety and social isolation?
Hi, I'm sorry you're feeling this way. I think it's really tough to be struggling with both depression and anxiety, because they're both such big feelings. It's tough to know what to do. When I was feeling this way, it felt like I was stuck in a cycle of feeling really down and then trying to force myself to be OK again. It was really hard. What I recommend is that you talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you understand how these two things are connected. They may be able to help you figure out a plan to break the cycle and move forward. Talking to someone can also make you feel better, because you can tell them everything and they can help you figure out ways to deal with your feelings.

I was anxious to go to middle school. I was afraid of what people might say about me, so when school started, I wasn't acting like myself. I was quiet, which I'm usually not. I didn't talk to anybody and didn't have any friends. Then a few years later, my grandma died.
It sounds like your anxiety had a lot to do with how you were feeling during these different stages of your life. According to the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive anxiety and related symptoms that significantly interfere with daily life. In some cases, the anxiety is so severe that it leads to physical health problems, such as heart racing, shortness of breath, or nausea. From what you have written, it sounds like the anxiety from your experiences with bullying and your grandma's death led to a prolonged state of anxiety. Unfortunately, when we are anxious, our body goes into survival mode and we start to disconnect from our feelings and our surroundings. This can make it difficult to form new relationships because we are not able to share our feelings and we are not able to trust other people. There are many ways to address anxiety and its effects, and I would be happy to help you find the best approach for you.

I feel as though I'm suffering severe abandonment issues stemming from childhood. I convince myself I'm not worthy of happiness, and I’m always afraid I'm doing something wrong. It's as if I create little scenarios in my mind, and I start to believe them.
It sounds like you are carrying a lot of emotional weight, and it is taking a toll on your mental and physical health.You may want to consider talking to a therapist about how you are feeling. Explaining your history and how abandonment has affected you in the past can be really helpful in understanding why you are feeling this way right now. Additionally, therapy can help you learn how to identify and deal with these thoughts and scenarios. Additionally, working on healthy coping mechanisms can be really helpful.
