        "PREDICTION": "While difficult, a long distance relationship can provide some difficulties as well. I have to say that many people have been in a long distance relationship and they were not loving at all.Your girlfriend has a crush and she is in the process of knowing what she wants.In the meantime, she wants to be with you.What do you want?Stay true to your wishes and give her space.Do not try to persuade her to come back.Give her time to understand what she wants, who she is and what she is looking for in a relationship.Do not try to rush her.Wait and see how she is doing and if she wants to work on the relationship.From what you write, it sounds as if you care a great deal about her and it is obvious that you are very much in love with her.Trust that she is having her own process and give her time.There is always hope that she will come back.Sending lots of caring energy your way!",
        "TARGET": "\"No one can tell you how to deal with your own relationship, even a therapist. But, you should absolutely give your girlfriend the respect of believing both of those statements she gives you: development of feelings and it being a \"\"crush.\"\" If that makes you feel a certain way (mistrustful? no difference in feelings) then that is what is most important to understand. When you understand exactly how YOU feel about hearing this news, then we can know how you should deal with this.You have every right to be in the relationship or to leave the relationship. But if trust is broken, first and foremost it needs repairing. What that repair looks like varies (but can often involve couples therapy, which may be complicated because of the long-distance nature of the relationship.) Otherwise, staying in a relationship that has become mistrustful for you, and not prioritizing the repair, is a recipe for disaster.\""

Avoidance is a sign of fear, but fear doesn't have to control you. You can be at peace with your past and move forward into your present and future. You are not a prisoner to your past. With the right tools you can move forward, have peace and build a brighter future. I highly recommend seeking the guidance of a professional therapist.

        "TARGET": "\"Hello, and thank you for your question. I am very sorry that you are experiencing this. To be honest, this kind of behavior is really emotionally abusive, and you likely know that already. The unfortunate truth is, there is very little we can\u00a0actually\u00a0do to change another adult's behavior if they are not interested in changing it. Many people who behave in this way actually feel justified in saying what they say, or even believe that they are \"\"helping\"\" in some way by telling you how to improve yourself. What is actually going on is an attempt to control or change something about you by being coercive and abusive. It is important to know that this kind of behavior doesn't necessarily show up right away. That is why I am not surprised that you are a year in to this relationship and are just now noticing these behaviors. Some people actually don't see them until they are already married! You didn't mention that there has been any physical abuse, but I would warn you that this is sometimes a possibility once a person has already begun to be emotionally abusive. Other things to watch out for is your boyfriend trying to control who you hang out with, what you do and how you dress, etc. These are just more examples of emotional abuse and control. Here are some things to consider and some ideas:1. You could talk to your boyfriend about this behavior, if you believe it is safe to do so. Perhaps he will recognize that his behavior is not okay, and change. If not, then you may need to decide what you want to do about this relationship, given the fact that you cannot force him to change. 2. You can call a local domestic violence program. They do not only work with people who have been physically abused\u00a0or have been married. They are trained to talk about emotional abuse, also. It may be a good thing for support. Your calls are confidential. 3. Check out the wheel in the link below. On it you will find some other common ways that abuse can happen in a relationship. If any of these are happening to you, or begin to happen, talking to a domestic violence program, a trusted friend or family member, or\u00a0a counselor would be a good idea.\u00a0http://www.domesticviolence-wilm.org/Portals/97/Images/violence_wheel.gif\u00a0 Be well....

        "TARGET": "\"It sounds like you may be asking two different questions.With regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom, I wonder if you would consider asking him more about this. If you choose to do that, I would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience. This can be difficult to do at times, particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type. Consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion. It may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like \"\"what, how, who, where, when.\"\" Questions that start with \"\"why,\"\" can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood.\u00a0Also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly. If what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years, it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially. Remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying, just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing. I also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation, but this could be done with many different topics over time.You could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are having.As far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience, maybe if you can discuss what it is that you don't like and/or understand what it is that he does like, you could see if there is some middle ground here. It depends on what you both prefer.These types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples, at least initially. Having structured conversations, such as the ones I've described briefly above, can feel awkward initially, but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argument.Also consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas.\""

        "PREDICTION": "\"Hello, and thank you for your question. I have had many people ask me this over the years, and the answer is not simple, because it is a dynamic interaction between thoughts and our belief system. The \"\"scary thought\"\" is a thought in your mind that scares you. It could be something that you have seen in the media, on the street, or even something that you have read on the internet. What happens is that when we have an emotion that scares us, our mind has several automatic responses that happen to try and deal with the emotion. Sometimes these responses are things that we \"\"just don't want to deal with,\"\" but unfortunately we have to (it's how the human brain works). But here's the thing...we don't really want those things. We really want the emotion to stop, but our brain has not taught us how to stop these automatic responses, so we don't know how to stop them. We can, however, stop them from having power over us. So how do we stop the response? What if we stopped the response and replaced it with something else? You might be asking yourself what you could replace that response with. Your brain knows what it is telling you. It is telling you that the scary thought is a fact, and that \"\"fact\"\" is going to happen, so you better believe it!",

        "PREDICTION": "What has been helpful for you is to communicate your feelings to someone that you trust. This could be a friend, family member, or another adult. If you can find someone that you can talk to about your feelings, it will make it easier for you to express yourself. Although your feelings are tough to experience, being able to talk about them with someone that you trust will help relieve some of the burden. Keep in mind that you may feel a lot of things during this time. It is normal to feel sadness, loneliness, anger, and a lot of other things that you may experience. You may even feel a lot of different emotions at the same time. The best thing you can do is express yourself and keep track of your feelings. It is important to have a record of your emotions so that you can track your emotions as they come and go. This way, you can be aware of what is happening and learn to accept yourself. Remember that you are not alone and that there are a lot of people out there that are feeling the same way that you are feeling. We all experience tough emotions at times and it is okay to talk about how we feel. Now that you have expressed yourself, it is time to reflect and learn from your experiences and how you are feeling. Reflecting on what you learned from the experience can help you cope with your situation. If you learned anything from your experience, you will have a better idea of what to do next time that you may encounter a similar situation. For example, if you learned that you could not handle a situation and it made you feel sad, you could learn to take time to cope with your emotions by talking to someone you trust or by doing something that you enjoy. Although you may be feeling a lot of different emotions, learning to cope with those emotions and accept yourself can help you in the long run. I suggest that you consider seeing a counselor so that you can begin to cope with these emotions in a healthy way. A counselor can provide you with resources and help you learn coping skills that will allow you to deal with your emotions in a healthy and productive way. A counselor can also provide a safe environment for you to discuss your feelings. Remember that it is okay to feel how you feel and that you are not alone. Remember that learning to cope with your emotions is a process.",

Throughout the entire first day that we met, he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. That same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom's acknowledgment) and we kissed. The next two days were a repetition of the first day. On the third night, my mother finally caught us, and I was kicked out of my house. I left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. It was very hard for us. His stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot. Our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. After that, it was a downward spiral. We were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. We kept having the famous \"\"you're doing it wrong\u2014do it this way\"\" argument. After six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. One afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. He told me to let him leave or he would hit me. He had once promised he would never touch me, so I challenged him to do it. He slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. I haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. I don't live with him, I don't depend on him, and we don't have children. We both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. He always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. Now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how I don't ever make the effort to try to be okay. I've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. I know he has to change that on his own.

A full assessment/evaluation with a mental health professional is warranted to understand if indeed you meet criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder i.e.., are delressed. One thing I often tell patients is that \"\"Do you think you are depressed?\"\" People often answer yes or no, but many individuals respond with a question: How would I know? To that I often explain that if I stopped watching movies or better, stopped enjoying watching movies that would be a clear indication for me that I am delressed. It would be a sign that I have lost pleasure or interest in the activity that I typically enjoy most . I'll ask you to think of one activity which you really really enjoy. \u00a0It could be anything from reading, to being with friends, to skiing to watching tv. \u00a0I would like to now ask you if you have stopped enjoying that activity or can't find the motivation to engage in it? This is another symptom of depression: loss in pleasurable activities. The good news is that there are many effective, available treatment if you are indeed in a depression or simply, you want to modify/decrease your depressive symptoms i.e., you want to stop feeling so tired and so worthless. Treatment includes one or more of the following: psychotherapy, medication, exercise. Any one or combination of both of these can help to improve your mood. The even better news is that feeling that you are doing something wrong can diminish with appropriate treatment over time. \u00a0I hope you find this information helpful. The most important next step is to get evaluated by a mental health professional typically a psychologist or psychiatrist, and for both you and the professional to better understand your symptoms and your mood in the context of what is going on in your life.\""

It's important to find someone you can trust and confide in. If you are not close with your family, maybe you can find a friend or a family member who lives in another city. Having a teenaged friend who you can talk to might be helpful. That's because they are often less likely to judge you if you say you can't talk to a family member.

        "TARGET": "Hello, and thank you for your question. You are clearly a resourceful young person to reach out like this to find help. Good for you. I have a few ideas and perhaps some other counselors will add some thoughts, too.  First, good for you for taking care of yourself and making really good decisions \u2013 such as not getting into the car with dad when he is intoxicated. It is really important that you consider your safety above all else.  To answer your heading question, yes, it is quite common for people to blame themselves for other people\u2019s actions. There are various reasons why we do this. For one thing, someone may tell us that their behaviors are our fault. And depending on things like our relationship to that person, past experiences, and our self-esteem, we may actually start to believe it. What is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibility to be sure that you are safe and cared for, not the other way around.  As for the other things you mentioned, I am concerned about both your physical and emotional safety and well-being. It sounds like your father has an alcohol abuse problem, and living with someone who is struggling with addiction can be hard for anyone, let alone a teenager who is also trying to deal with things like school.  You may want to see if your school has a counselor or someone you can talk to about what is going on. I will tell you that in some states, what you have told me may be something that a counselor would have to report to child protection services, but not necessarily. If you are concerned about that, ask the counselor what they are obligated to report.  If you don\u2019t know a counselor, think about any other adult that you would feel comfortable talking to. They may have some ideas.  Sometimes individual states have non-profit chat lines or hotlines for teens to call if they are struggling with things. You may be able to find something like that in your state. I do warn your about doing random searches, not every website is good, so be careful.  This is clearly a tough spot for you to be in, so one of the things that I encourage you to do while searching for support is to focus on taking care of yourself. Sometimes things like this can really bring us down and we stop doing the things we enjoy. Try really hard not to let that happen. If you have interests, do them. If you catch yourself thinking too hard about things, try to find something fun to do to distract yourself. Try to take care of yourself in other ways, such as eating well. Exercise can really help when we get stressed.  I hope some of this was helpful. Good luck. \u00a0 Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"

I do think that a therapist would encourage the child to speak to them if they felt it would help in the child's healing process. In fact, the therapist might even suggest that the child do so.As a general rule, therapists do not participate in custody proceedings. In order to be able to provide the best support and care to a child, a therapist should not be getting involved in the process in any way. Even if the therapist was asked to assist in court proceedings, they would still be bound by the Code of Ethics and refuse to act in a way that conflicted with their Code of Ethics. If a child is being abused, a therapist may become involved in helping to protect the child from further harm, regardless of who the alleged perpetrator is. This is especially important if the therapist has any concerns about the competence of one parent in caring for the child. I'm not saying that this would be the case here, but I think it's worth noting that a therapist could intervene in this situation.I'm not sure how this question is being asked, but it seems like there are some other aspects that need to be considered as well.

Then, you learn to observe the experiences and sensations as if you were an outside observer, detached from the experience. You would be able to do this through meditation. Once you learn to be an outside observer, you can then work on your feelings about the event and what you are going through now. Even if you have no memory of the traumatic experience, the distress of it can affect you in many ways. And, now, if you have never dealt with that event directly, your brain is likely to \"\"react\"\" to that experience in the future by reminding you of it in future situations. In order for this to be resolved, you need to be able to bring awareness to the event and understand it on an emotional level, which allows you to have a new understanding of what it meant to you, and helps you feel more at ease.

        "TARGET": "\"Oh dear - this is becoming all too common.\u00a0 I suggest you have some conversations with your girl to figure out where she is getting the \"\"information\"\" that she builds anxiety around.\u00a0 I see teens\u00a0 who have heard teachers, parents, coaches, etc push the \"\"highly selective colleges\"\" idea on kids way too much.\u00a0 Teens in particular are prone to black and white thinking, leading them to see one poor test performance, one off day, one not-great assignment as the make-or-break task on the path to successful adulthood.\u00a0 If that's the case with your daughter, she needs you to help modulate both the incoming information (there are nearly 5000 colleges in the US - she will get into one of them!) as well as her reaction to that information.As well, you and any other adults that are involved in parenting her need to discern fact from fiction.\u00a0 The recent scandal around celebrities \"\"buying\"\" their kids into college is an indicator of how far off track we, as a culture, have gotten in terms of education.\u00a0 A college education is certainly important, but we have allowed the marketing push to create so much stress and upset for our kids (and ourselves as parents) that they are actually less prepared to leave home and really engage in higher education than ever.You may want to include a therapist in these conversations if you get stuck, but start with a parent-child conversation.\u00a0 Help her figure out what is going on - if it is the \"\"I have to get it right or I will have no future\"\", calmly walk her through all the evidence that says that's just not true.\u00a0 As well, let her know that being anxious now is NOT preparing her for a bright adulthood - it's preparing her for an anxious future.\u00a0 She needs help figuring out how to balance her effort to attend to real and reasonable expectations, not over-inflated fear-based actions.\""

Many of the pastors or leaders in these disciplines have significant training in counseling, as well as assisting with marriage and couples counseling. These services are ordinarily offered free of charge to members.Another option might be to explore support groups within the area. There may be a group in the form of a couples support group that brings couples together to explore their relationships in the safety of the group.

Has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him? \u00a0Or, is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence? Knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter, you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future. The more you focus on \"\"what if\"\" situations, the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure.\u00a0However, if there is reason for you to question his fidelity, you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a long-distance relationship. To help the conversation, you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust. Is that you wish him to contact you regularly, or to include you more in his life, or to make a clear commitment? For many of my clients in my private practice, that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text, phone, and Skype. It's hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner, and it's hard to build a relationship when you don't know what's going on in your partner's life. Other times, it is Making sure they talk often to their long-distance partner so that they can participate in each others lives and to feel their presence.. Regular communication, understanding and caring is the key to sustaining any relationship, but this is especially true for long-distance ones.\u00a0Dr. Virginia Chowwww.PsychologyResource.ca\""

It is important to remember that you can leave at any time, even if you are running late. You can also leave at any time during the day. So, before you begin to let the verbal abuse affect you, try to create a plan. Make sure that the plan includes at least one person you can call and that person should be another adult. If you can, try to leave with that person, but if you have to stay, try to have a place where you will be safe. If you can, consider leaving with a friend that you can trust. If you are physically unable to leave, try to remember that you can leave. It may be hard to remember that at first, but you can get back to a place where you feel safe. Remembering that you can leave at any time is the most important thing to remember. As far as how you should cope with the verbal abuse, I recommend a book by Lynn Staley called, Speaking to An Abuser: How Families Can Stop Living in Fear and Start Getting Their Lives Back. This book is extremely helpful and I would encourage you to read it. Also, you may want to consider seeing a counselor.

Sure, living with your parents with your child probably is not your dream scenario, nor your parents'. But, there are ways to process that without someone feeling abused, and your parents clearly have zero ability or boundaries if they are willing to verbally abuse you in front of your child, and their grandchild. If there is a reason they are doing so, I'm sure they think they have a good one. However, the dynamic that they are willingly setting up is problematic. And it is THEIR problem.\u00a0However, by being strong and not taking in someone's verbal abuse, you are going to role model for your child how it's about what is inside of you, your own drive, that will be what is important, NOT what others say about you. It's important to always come back to yourself inside, and seeing the good that is in you (or even just noticing that it's there, if you can't quite see it in its entirety.)I would also advise your parents to think about their own role modeling."

Then you will feel less alone.Also, in the interest of loving and trusting others, ask people you know for help. People are more likely to help someone who is in need of their help.Also, I suggest practicing being kind and loving to yourself. This is harder than asking for help. Start by saying nice things about yourself and then practice.Finally, life is about making choices. If your most difficult choice is to find someone to love and be loved by, I suggest you do the best job you can of finding love and learning how to give and receive love.Good luck in your search! :)\u00bfC\u00f3mo puedo encontrar a alguien que me ame?",

Once we have fears like this though, we start to pull away from people, the fears keep us isolated, which makes the thoughts worse, and the cycle continues.\u00a0We all have a place in this world. We all have value, we all deserve love, and there are safe, wonderful people out there waiting to meet you and care for you.\u00a0Can you take a moment right now to become more in touch with three things?

        "PREDICTION": "Hi there. This is a really common question and a really common pitfall people have when trying to build relationships. You are right - they might not be replying because they don't like you. But, is it possible they don't know who you are? This is often the case. There are many people on social media sites who message, and don't know each other in real life. You can take the time to research them, figure out why they're not replying, and then reach out again. Another factor here is timing. When you send the message, does the other person get it immediately? Or, does it take a few minutes for them to see it? The timing of the message is important. If it's only going to take a few minutes for them to read your message, and they are already in the middle of something else, you're not going to get a response. But, if you send it when they are available, you're more likely to get one. Another thing to consider is if this person has a public or private account. With some social media sites, if you have a public account and someone else doesn't, you're not going to be able to see each other's messages. With Snapchat and Instagram, however, you are both seeing each other's messages. If someone doesn't respond to you, don't get frustrated and assume they're ignoring you. They might not even know who you are. And, if they do know who you are, they might not want to be your friend, or they might not like you. These are all possibilities, but they're not facts. Another thing to consider is whether this person is really interested in you or not. Sometimes you can have the impression that people are interested, but in actuality they're not. If you're starting to feel frustrated by not getting the response you want, there are many other ways to connect with people in your life. Go out for coffee with a friend, stop in the store to say hi to a total stranger, or reach out to someone on social group that you know. We are all connected in some way, so it's always possible to build new relationships. Be well.Robin J.

It may also be helpful to look at the different areas of stress and develop strategies to effectively manage each area. This may require different strategies and goals depending on the area. Another option is to develop a self-care plan that allows you to effectively manage the areas of stress while building self-efficacy in areas such as managing relationships and stress. This self-care plan may include relaxing activities, rewarding yourself, and planning/prioritizing. A therapist can also help you integrate these strategies into your life and make sure they are working effectively. There are also many apps that are available to help you plan and track your self-care activities. These may be a good option if they help you incorporate self-care into your life while still managing other areas of stress. Also, being mindful of your stress is a good way to manage stress. Mindfulness is one way to increase your awareness of your current mental state and teach you skills for self-regulation. There are also many websites and apps that can help you learn mindfulness. It is important to note that mindfulness is not a panacea and should not be used to replace the use of effective strategies such as self-management plans. If you are interested in learning more about mindfulness and how it can help you manage stress, I would recommend reading Mindfulness for Dummies or Mindfulness for Insomniacs, both of which can help you learn the benefits of mindfulness.

        "TARGET": "\"Since it is clear that people react differently to the same\u00a0stressors, we know that the stressors are not causing the anxiety, our thoughts about the stressors are. Often, cognitive distortions are the problem. Some common cognitive distortions include catastrophizing (predicting the worst), future telling, black and white thinking (if it's not perfect, it's terrible), mind-reading (I just know he is angry at me) and can't-standitis (I can't stand this situation). There are more, but the list is long, and if some of these are resonating with you, I would advise looking up CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) tips, worksheets, booklets etc. on line, or contact a local CBT therapist. Another helpful piece of info on anxiety, is that it is prone to something called \"\"symptom stress\"\" - being anxious about anxiety. If we could hear this symptom stress it might sound like, \"\"Oh no I'm getting nervous about this, I'm getting uptight, I look nervous, what if I have a panic attack!\"\" followed by\u00a0\u00a0more cognitive distortions such as \"\"I can't stand being anxious!\"\" and \"\"this is horrible!\"\"\u00a0The\u00a0antidote to this is acceptance.\u00a0 Kind of like not stopping the waves but learning to surf instead (Jon Kabat-Zinn).

I can tolerate and survive some anxiety, I can breathe deeply,\u00a0and I'll be OK because panic attacks never killed anyone. I can stand this and it is temporary. You get the idea.We can increase our awareness of anxiety-provoking self-talk, and counteract it with calming and reassuring self-talk. We have the ability to think about our thinking, decide which thoughts are healthy and which are unhealthy, and choose which to focus on. We brainwash ourselves with our thinking, and according to self-perception theory, \"\" we learn what we\u00a0believe when we hear ourselves speak,\"\" so we may as well be a calming, reassuring presence in our own minds. :)\""

    "You are a counselor and your client approachs you with their concern.\nClient: My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year\u2019s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board\u2014no more drinking every night.  The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep\u2014it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.\nYou:": {

        "TARGET": "\"Hi Los Angeles,So your husband is giving you mixed messages. He says he's willing to cut back on the drinking, but he drinks and hides it. His behaviour is passive aggressive and immature, which puts you into this position of having to act like a disapproving parent. It sounds more like you're talking about an out-of-control teenager than your partner.\u00a0Your husband's lying is sending a message. \"\"I get to make my own decisions and you can't stop me\"\" might be it. Underneath that, maybe it's \"\"I want to stop but I'm ashamed that I can't and I don't want you to see my failures\"\". Ultimately, as an adult, he gets to decide what he puts in his mouth and if you try to manage that by monitoring how many beers he has, you are pretty certain to get some fallout... pushback...backlash... \u00a0How does his drinking affect you? That's where your voice has power, rather than in counting his beers or setting him up to lie (when he's passed out, asking if he's been drinking seems confusing). You've mentioned snoring, which I guess is a legitimate complaint. If he's passing out, that's a legitimate complaint. When he drinks does he drive, act aggressively, or 'check out of' the relationship (avoid you)? All of these things are legitimate concerns, and I'd stick to talking about those rather than counting beers. My guess is he has few other ways to cope with stress, so he checks out with alcohol, and it also helps him avoid your relationship. But the problem is it makes it worse; the more he avoids you, then more you chase him with your questions.There's a conversation that would be helpful here. \u00a0It sounds like \"\"I've tried to support you in your drinking less, and it's not working. What are your goals for alcohol and how can I support you in that more effectively?\"\" I'd like to see you in a place where you're not micromanaging his drinking, but focusing on the things that affect you. What concrete supportive methods can you use with his agreement? Can we get the alcohol out of the house? Is he willing to seek treatment?\u00a0Lay your expectations out really clearly. \"\"I won't count your beers, but I can't tolerate lying\"\". You have to decide what's more important; is it really the number of beers, or is it something else. What do you need to happen in order to want to remain in the marriage? What does he need? Does he let you know what isn't okay with him? He might have trouble saying these things.\u00a0The drinking is only a part of the complex dynamic in your marriage. A qualified therapist can assist in pulling this apart, understanding it, and changing the way you relate to each other.\""

It's extremely difficult to see our spouse making negative statements when they are hurtful and take them at face value.

You can find an excellent book that discusses this topic in detail, The Truth About Love by Dr. Sue Johnson.

Learning about emotional and verbal manipulation can help you be able to have clear conversations with each other. It will also help you be able to have a therapist guide you through the process.

I have counseled many individuals who have anxiety and panic attacks. This article by Psych Central is a great resource: http://www.psychcentral.com/lib/ways-to-handle-anxiety-in-humans/ One of the most common and effective ways to decrease anxiety is to do cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with a professional counselor. You can also do CBT alone by utilizing the techniques taught in the Cognitive Behavioral Workbook Series. Another method for decreasing anxiety is through the use of self-help books. I would recommend the books listed here: http://www.therapy4selfhelp.com/self-help-books-anxiety.htmlAs for your relationship, it sounds as if you may be in a rut. If you are not being fulfilled in your relationship, you may want to consider seeing a relationship therapist to see if there are ways to increase the intimacy and intimacy-related behaviors between you. You may also want to consider seeing a therapist to address your career and relationship. A therapist may be able to assess your level of happiness and what areas of your life you may want to change. It is important to be honest with yourself and question the reasons behind your discomfort and what may be causing it. If you are having panic attacks while driving or at work, I would recommend calling 911 and receiving immediate medical care. The anxiety and panic attacks you are experiencing may be signs of a medical condition. I would recommend going to see a doctor. Another method for decreasing anxiety is through medication. If anxiety medication is a necessity for you, you may want to consider a psychiatrist who specializes in working with individuals who suffer from anxiety.I hope this was helpful.

I think you know that already.You must have moved in with him for a reason, and it's appropriate now to simply trust that, to ask him for some patience, and to focus on learning to manage the anxiety rather than questioning this decision to move in. Fear is getting in the way of you trusting yourself and your decision. You can figure the anxiety piece out while living with your boyfriend.When you're in a bit of a crisis is not the right time to make a major change. I suggest you use a therapist who works with cognitive behavioural therapy to learn to manage the anxiety, and then the relationship will likely seem more clear."

That sounds more like you want to live as a woman than that you feel you are one already.In the past, you may have heard the word \"\"transsexual\"\" and assumed it was the same as what you're saying. It isn't. A transsexual person is a person who feels they were born into the wrong body and want to change it. You may want to be a woman but that doesn't mean that you want to change your body. You may want to live as a woman, but that doesn't mean you would want to change your body.If you really are considering changing your body, I would recommend seeing a therapist first.

        "TARGET": "Hello, and thank you for reaching out to ask for help. Surely this is a very confusing time for you! If you have never had these feelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knew about yourself.  My guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this started is likely a coincidence, but I understand how you would make the connection.  I have a feeling that a few things may be going on here. It is really hard to say since I don\u2019t know you, how old you are, etc. But, I will share you with you some thoughts.  Some people, when they have undesirable thoughts that really surprise them, have a really tough time getting rid of them. Our reaction to the thought can be very strong and our tendency to try to block it out, stuff it, avoid it, etc. is not always successful. In fact, it\u2019s usually not.  It\u2019s like telling you not to think of pink elephants. I would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now.  So, rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing, sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity and without judgement. Where is this thought coming from? What are my feelings about it? Asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution about what is going on.  One possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them, but another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and gender. I get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe that it is second possibility. And that is okay.  You can try some of my suggestions, but you can also see a counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion. I would suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues. You can usually find out what a counselor works with on their website. What is important is that you find someone who is non-judgmental about what you are experiencing.  \u00a0 I wish you well.

First, I want to say that if you are only reading through the first couple of responses, I commend you for being honest about your feelings and for asking for some feedback. It is very rare to see this type of honesty. As for your question, I believe that you may have some depression or a more serious mood disorder. I can tell this from your description of what you are experiencing, but it would be difficult to diagnose you from that description. It sounds like your symptoms are interfering with your daily life in a negative way. It sounds like you are very unhappy and would like some help. In my professional opinion, I would recommend you see a medical doctor to rule out a medical cause for your symptoms. If you are diagnosed with depression, a prescription for an antidepressant will likely help you feel better and get your life back on track. It sounds like you are trying to figure out what to do. In addition, there are many organizations and websites that offer free counseling. I recommend that you look into getting some counseling. Counseling may not fix your problem, but it will likely help you cope with your problem. There are many different types of counselors, and there are many different types of counseling. Some counselors may be better suited for a specific type of problem. If you can get counseling from a therapist who specializes in depression, I think that would be a good idea. If you are unable to get counseling, I would recommend trying to find some friends who you can talk to about your feelings. Maybe that is something that you can do over lunch or at a work event?",

If you haven't seen a primary care provider in a while, you may want to. There are health conditions that can affect your mood and energy levels, even at your age. It doesn't hurt to get checked out. If they find the cause, they may be able to treat it and improve the symptoms. In addition, most primary care providers are trained to be able to manage medication for patients who have mild, moderate, and sometimes severe depression. So, don't be surprised if your primary care doctor offers to put you on an anti-depressant if they diagnose you with depression. Medication is not the only way to treat depression, but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors.2. You may want to consider counseling, since it is another effective way to treat depression. A counselor will help you explore the factors that may be leading to depressive symptoms in the first place. This could include thoughts, behaviors, beliefs, life experiences, and other things. 3. Finally, to answer your question about whether these feelings are \"\"normal.\"\" These symptoms could be the sign of an underlying general health or mental health condition. It is important to remember that even if these symptoms are \"\"abnormal\"\" it doesn't mean that YOU are. Millions of people struggle with depression.

For example, did a parent or another loved one criticize you or put you down often? Were you bulled in school? Has a romantic partner emotionally abused you? Usually, there are factors such as these which insidiously lead to low self esteem and self loathing. Once you can identify some of the factors that lead to your self hatred, you can make a decision to not let these things from your past have such power over you any more. You learn to take control of how you feel about yourself, rather than letting others dictate that for you.\u00a0I do think it is possible to heal from self hatred. It doesn't happen over night, and it takes time and effort. It is about re-training your brain to focus on your strengths rather than on your weaknesses. None of us are ever going to be perfect, and if we look for a flaw we are bound to find one (or two, or three...). Try keeping a self esteem journal. Every night, write down three things that you were proud of that day about yourself.

She then started to act younger than she is. Now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesn't act her age. I don't know why this is happening. Is this normal?\nYou:": {
        "PREDICTION": "\"While I agree that \"\"normal\"\" is a slippery term, I do see that you are very concerned about your daughter's behavior. While there is no absolute answer as to why a child would suddenly behave a certain way (even if it is for a brief time), it is helpful to try to gather as much information as possible about the child and their situation to try and understand what might be going on. One thing to consider is that many children who are in the 9-10 year old range are still being evaluated and treated as younger children. Children in this age range may seem \"\"normal\"\", but they are probably not. Some of the behaviors that I see can be as simple as a child wanting to play with other children or wanting to play a certain kind of game that they did not play as a child. But, there could be a lot more to it. A child may feel more comfortable with other children their own age. Younger children may have more energy and may want to spend more time with adults who are still in a very energy-intensive phase of their life. So, if we look at the situation from this perspective, I would consider talking with your daughter about what she is interested in and see if she would be willing to spend more time with you and her siblings to see what is going on. I would also ask her what she is doing when she is not with you, her siblings, and the other children who she likes to play with. If she is spending more time with younger children, I would see if she could see the other children that she likes to play with. This could be a short-term or a long-term situation. I would also consider talking with a mental health provider to see if they could help you see what is going on. If your daughter is younger than 10 and is interested in an older child, I would encourage you to try and find out what it is that they are interested in. If they are interested in an older sibling, I would encourage you to ask the older sibling to spend more time with the younger one.

Often they struggle, perhaps out of shame; maybe they don't want me to know their worst thoughts. But I can help them better if I do know, because then we have a place to work from. You are feeling hopeless and worthless, and your thoughts support these intense emotions.\u00a0I don't know you, but I strongly believe that you have someone in your life who, if they heard your thoughts, would say \"\"That's not true. I know where her value is.\"\" I believe that there are people who would see your value clearly, even if in small things. Can you imagine those voices?You mentioned God, so let's invite God into the conversation. What might God say to you? What evidence might God...who sees all..have of your worth? What hint might God give you about your purpose?\u00a0You suffer from severe anxiety, and the agoraphobia works together with fear; they're a tag team. Fear tells you perhaps that people will reject you (or something equally bad), and then agoraphobia steps in and traps you and uses as evidence the fact that no one seems to be reaching out to you to convince you that you have no worth. Do you see their plan? Make her scared... keep her here alone...convince her it's hopeless. They both try to convince you that they are your only friends, except they're lying to you. They only want power over you.You forget your worth. You forget that we all have worth. No one is a waste. I believe all God's creatures have worth, and that we're here to use our gifts to improve the world, and to remind each other of our value. There are people out there needing your support as much as you need theirs. Can you find them? My guess is you've been alone and isolated for a very long time and it's impossible for you to see your worth in this situation. We need mirrors to see our worth and other people are our mirrors. We see our value in their eyes.\u00a0Do you remember the first time you questioned your worth? What was happening that you blamed yourself for? Can you speak to that child and tell her (or him) that whatever's happening isn't her fault? It's that child who cannot see her own worth, probably because someone treated her as though she had none. That's only a story though; not the truth. Can you find another thread of a story? Who might tell a story of your worth?Oak Harbor, I believe that there is help closer than you think. Fear wants you to believe it's hopeless. You reached out here...can you reach out again? Start with just one person, and that will lead you to somewhere. We don't know where that somewhere is but could it be better than sitting alone? You've stopped living. You can choose any moment to start.\u00a0I wish you peace and hope. :)\""

    "You are a counselor and your client approachs you with their concern.\nClient: For the past four weeks, I've been having nightmares and hearing voices telling me of horrible things. They're not random voices, but rather, the voices of those I care about.\nYou:": {
        "PREDICTION": "\"Hello, and thank you for your question. I am always interested in learning more about how people are managing their symptoms, as well as other aspects of their lives.The short answer is that a lot of people have different reactions to experiencing symptoms of a condition like PTSD. It can be difficult to tell if you are having a recurrence of symptoms, or if the symptoms are a result of the experiences that led to your symptoms. If you are hearing voices in your nightmares, this may be related to the trauma. However, hearing voices in the day-to-day life of your waking experience may also be related to your trauma. So, it is very important to talk to someone about your experiences if you are having these symptoms. I also want to make clear that it can be difficult to distinguish between symptoms related to PTSD and other conditions. It is common for people to experience anxiety and/or panic attacks after experiencing a trauma. In some cases, these symptoms can be quite traumatic for people. So, it is important that people talk to someone about the symptoms if they are experiencing them. There are also many people who do not experience PTSD symptoms and still have a lot of trauma related experiences. One of the things that is really helpful for some people is mindfulness practices. Mindfulness is a way of being in the present moment and being aware of your thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations. Mindfulness is a practice that many people use to help them manage their symptoms. While mindfulness can be helpful, it should not be considered a cure for trauma. If you are interested in learning more about mindfulness, it would be helpful to find an experienced therapist. Also, it is important that you always talk to your primary care provider or doctor if you are experiencing any type of health related symptom, including anxiety and panic attacks.

I am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues. I am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like I used to. What could be causing this, and what can I do about it?\nYou:": {
        "PREDICTION": "\"Thank you for your question. There are several possible reasons for a decrease in sexual drive, including: (1) The presence of medical disorders such as diabetes, thyroid disease, kidney disease, and endocrine system disorders (PCOS); (2) Anxiety and fear of losing the ability to perform sexually, anxiety and fear of disappointing your partner and/or fear of disappointing yourself; (3) Fear of having to go through with a medical procedure that requires you to be completely relaxed and naked; (4) Fear of being inadequate or not satisfying your partner sexually; (5) Fear of not being good enough in the eyes of the God to whom you pray and trust; (6) Fear of feeling inadequate in the eyes of your partner; (7) Fear of being overwhelmed by the desire to have sex and having no time to sit down and relax yourself; (8) Fear of being caught up in a moment of temptation; (9) Feeling pressured by a friend or family member to have sex; and (10) Any combination of these causes. It is hard to know exactly what is going on without direct and honest communication between you and your wife. You may have other contributing factors that you are not aware of, or your wife may not be willing to discuss with you some of the issues that may be contributing to her distress. If you can both agree that she would like to discuss her feelings and experiences with you, you may be able to get some answers together. In general, if there is an erection, but no physical intercourse, the sexual desire is there. If there is no erection, then the problem is that the physical, emotional, and spiritual connection is not there for either of you. You may have to consider some changes in the way that you approach your relationship, in order to increase the physical intimacy and emotional closeness. And, you may have to start making some changes in your approach to who you are as a sexual partner to your wife. Do you want to be intimate with her?",
        "TARGET": "Assuming there are no medical explanations for this issue, many men I've worked with on this come to see it as essentially a form of Anxiety. There is a phenomenon called the Yerkes Dodson Law (see below; source: Wikipedia), which basically states that if we feel either too much or too little stress, pressure, or nervousness about a task, it will adversely impact our ability to do carry it out successfully.\u00a0The ideal amount of stress/arousal is right in the middle - not too little and not too much. This applies to more things than we might often realize - from giving a presentation, to ordering food, to making a free throw, to driving, to sexual intimacy as in this case. A common suggestion that many men find helpful is initiating open and honest conversations with their partners about this issue, and for a temporary period of time, agreeing to physical intimacy and sexual pleasure in other forms, and without the expectation of intercourse. There are many ways to go about that (which are outside the scope of this blog article), but this can be a path to connecting intimately and renewing physical bonding without unhelpful anxiety - and over time, can lead back to intimacy in all the ways that have become elusive. Best of luck."

        "PREDICTION": "I think this is probably a lot of things. I am not 100% sure that this is depression, but I believe that it could be. Often times, when we hear the word depression we tend to think that it means feeling really sad or down, but it is much more than that. Depression is a spectrum disorder and so it can be broken down into many different sub-types. One of the differentiating factors between major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder is that dysthymic disorder is not accompanied by a significant amount of sadness. I wonder if this young lady is experiencing the symptoms of depression, but is not calling it that. The only way you can really know for sure is to have her evaluate her feelings with a counselor. I wonder if she is taking medication for the symptoms that she is experiencing. In general, the types of symptoms that this young lady is having could be symptoms of major depression, but it could also be symptoms of a variety of other disorders as well.One of the things that you can do is to offer her options when it comes to treatment. If she is experiencing the symptoms and is not willing to seek treatment, you can use the resources that are available to you through your school's student health center. It might be worth contacting them and having them speak to your daughter about making use of the services that they have available. It is also important to have her evaluated by a counselor if she decides to seek treatment.In general, though, I would recommend that she take her feelings seriously, talk to her counselor about how she is feeling and see if she can get some treatment. In the meantime, I would recommend that you continue to check in with her and if there are times that she is not eating, she may be experiencing some of the symptoms of anorexia or bulimia. It is also important that she gets plenty of rest, and it might be worth having her talk to someone about feeling down or being overly tired. Hope this helps and good luck! Take care. Robin J.

And I can assure you that you are not alone in struggling with how to deal with it. So many do, and that's why it gets done so often, because it can. For example, if you push for connection, he stonewalls even more. You probably become more distressed.Frankly, if you and your boyfriend were sitting on my couch in therapy, I'd likely say that the behavior needs to stop in order for the relationship to continue, because of how severe it sounds (an hour of withdrawal because someone can't deal is reasonable, as everyone can shut down from time to time, but this feels extreme and is extremely hurtful to you.) I might even say to him that the behavior needs to stop if he ever wants to be in a healthy, loving, connected relationship. Because the amount that you describe him disconnecting severely hurts trust and security. One of the first \"\"change events\"\" in Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy is for the person doing the withdrawing to be able to use words and communication to help the partner understand what they are experiencing, so the burden does fall more on him at the beginning. It becomes the partner's job to tolerate though whatever his experience is.There is no one \"\"tried and true\"\" solution to working with passive-aggression, but I would most advise limit-setting (like I would do in our session). In one way, shape, or form, in order for the behavior to stop, there has to be consequences to it. The more you tolerate it and allow him to come back to you when he's done with his silent tantrum, the more you encourage the behavior because he is getting what he wants.\""

        "PREDICTION": "It is always a challenge to keep a relationship, especially when there is abuse. It is important to remember that relationships require two people to be happy and healthy. It is important to consider how you can work together to make the relationship better. If abuse is present it is important to have a plan in place to leave the abusive relationship. If you are unable to leave, it is important to have a safety plan and a way to communicate about safety. Communication is key and can be a barrier to abuse when it is difficult to communicate about important things. Having a safe person that you can talk to about these things is important. Now, there are some people that do not abuse but may have issues with their behavior. This would be called \u201ccodependency.\u201d Codependents have issues with controlling behaviors and have trouble asking for what they need. It is important to see a professional to help with these issues. It is important to remember that if a relationship is not healthy, it will not last. It is important to stay focused on your own happiness. Finding your own hobbies and interests is important so that you can have time to do things that make you happy. Remembering to take care of yourself is important. Not doing things that you know will make you sick, such as drinking too much or engaging in risky behaviors is also important.

As a married stepmother, I've been there, and as a therapist, I can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy. Finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful - being able to hear from others that you aren't alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load, and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations. Another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with step/blended family dynamics - because even if you're not officially married, those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved.

How ironic is that?There's another irony here...your goal is to be a better partner...but when you are self-critical, your focus is on you, not her. Every moment that fear grabs ahold of you is a moment that you're not being present in the actual relationship; you're gazing at your imagined faults.

If you feel sad on most days, it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression. Feeling sadness is a normal response to loss, whether you lose a family, friend, job, or something you deem important in your life. However, feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life. If it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our self-esteem and self-worth, then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family. Is it that you do not feel heard, supported or loved? Is it that you feel disrespected, disregarded or feel unimportant? These are just a few examples of common issues that people report that contribute to their depression. To help you to uncover your reasons for your sadness or depression and to cope with them in a healthier and more constructive way, it may be helpful to contact a therapist who could support you with this process.

That requires the two adults to act like adults with each other for the sake of their child.What's confusing for children is seeing their parents act uncivilly or manipulatively. Children also do well with routines so regular dependable visitation is preferable to random visitation or, worse, not following through on commitments.But if one person is exploiting their child to harm their ex-partner, then visiting your child in that context may be stressful to him/her (depending on what you mean by using your child as a pawn). When dealing with a hostile ex-partner, your first challenge is to negotiate rules and boundaries with your ex-partner about appropriate behavior for the good of your child.

I'm glad you're questioning some of the assumptions you've made about yourself and you're even taking steps to get some support to move past this. I'm so proud of you. It takes courage to go through what you are going through. I wish I had some words of encouragement, but this is really a time to listen to your own inner guidance. I'd be curious to know what has led you to some of your thoughts about yourself, but I also encourage you to be curious about your new thoughts. I imagine there are times when you have taken those old hurtful thoughts and given them a voice. I'm curious if you can see the voice and then ask the voice to step aside so you can hear the new voice...maybe that voice is saying that these people have done nothing to you to hurt you. It's natural to have different thoughts about people we care about and it's also healthy to confront old hurts. The next question is what do you want?",

        "TARGET": "I agree with Sherry that in a close intimate relationship, you are entitled to ask questions about his relationship with significant others. These questions help couples to build connection and trust. It's based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason (support, openess, understanding, empathy), you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive. How he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him. If your partner responds in an open and understanding manner, it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance. If he responds in a defensive manner, it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide. Either way, you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that. If he continues to be defensive or evasive, then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actions.Dr. Virginia Chowwww.PsychologyResource.ca"

I would encourage you to take a look at the image that you have of God. Is it loving? Unforgiving? Does it make you feel safe or nervous? This is a good time to talk to a therapist about all of this. What you believe about God directly affects how you feel about yourself and how you interact with others.I hope this helps you out.

If you are short on money, there still may be options for you to be able to see a therapist. Check with your insurance provider about your behavioral health coverage.

Do you know where your fear started? If you think it is still protecting you or helping you in some way, talk with someone (like a therapist) about it.If it is something that you know is irrational (for example, fear of being hurt by static cling from winter clothing), is there some part of that that you are not afraid of?I really encourage you to consider whether your fear has a lot of emotions connected to it or if it ties from something in your past that was very emotional for you at the time. If it does, consider working with a therapist to establish emotional safety before taking away the fear or anxiety that may actually be helpful to you.Also, the fact that you notice that you are afraid of something and you don't want to be afraid of it anymore is a big step in the forward direction."

In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner.

        "TARGET": "\"First off, it is great that you recognize that some changes need to be made. It is also really good that you understand where the source of your anxiety and stress comes from. Fortunately there are many self help books and internet sources that provide free tools to help you cope with\u00a0life's obstacles, including anger management. There are several strategies that you can try to\u00a0help control your anger, but the\u00a0ones that\u00a0I would recomend first are the following:1.\u00a0Try a different way of communicating with your parents. Since\u00a0arguing with\u00a0them is a great source of anger for you, learning more effective ways of communicating with them will likely be of great benefit.\u00a0Choose a time to talk with them\u00a0about \"\"heated issues\"\" when everyone is calm and emotions are not heightened. Use \"\"I phrases\"\" by telling them how the arguments effect you, as opposed to placing blame on them.\u00a0Validate what you hear your parents say in order to allow them to know that you understand their point of view.2. When you feel yourself becoming angry, take a break. Simply excuse yourself from the situation, find a quiet place to be by yourself, and do some deep breathing. Close your eyes, slowly count to four as you inhale, and exhale\u00a0even slower, counting to 6. Focus on nothing except for your breathing and do this for 5 minutes.3. Stop any negative thoughts in their tracks. Often times when we get upset, we catastrophize and do not see things clearly. When you catch yourself thinking negatively stop the thoughts and ask yourself if your thinking is logical and rational. If you cannot find much or any evidence that your thoughts are valid, then let them go and replace them with realistic, logical thoughts.4. Finally, find a friend or someone to talk to and/or keep a journal. Keeping your emotions to yourself will not help you. Being able to express your feelings and problem solve will allow for some relief when feeling sad or angry.I wish you all the best!\""

I'm glad you're paying attention to it.\u00a0When you first meet someone, there are all kinds of sparkly feelings and you both do and say lots of things to cement the attachment and create deep intimacy and connection. Then what happens is because we have that connection established, we instinctively cut back on those loving behaviours because we don't have to work hard to earn their love anymore. That sparkly feeling typically lasts a few years (long enough to procreate and keep the human race going), and then it wears off a bit, and you end up looking at each other thinking \"\"how come I don't feel the same anymore?\"\"Mostly (not always, and I'll get to that in a minute) all that this means is you've stopped doing all those loving things you used to do! It's as though you filled the car with gas, you've run out of gas now, and you're forgetting to put more in!The first clear solution to this feeling is to bring back more of your own loving behaviours that you've cut back on. Act lovingly, and you will likely regain those feelings. Talk to your partner about this. It's okay to say \"\"do you remember we used to do X,Y and Z? Can we do that again? Can I get more of the foot rubs you used to give me?\"\" Ask for what you want (instead of complaining). What are your 'love languages'? What are your partner's?\u00a0Marriages need to be fed.

        "PREDICTION": "It sounds like you have already figured out that being in a relationship is not the right path for you. You might be happy spending time with your friends, which is the perfect way to spend time with them. I agree that this message repeats itself over and over, so it is possible that there is someone in your life that you are trying to win over. If you are not able to reach this person, it is OK. It might help to know that there are many people who share your thoughts and feelings about wanting a relationship. I encourage you to surround yourself with positive people and try not to focus on what you cannot have. There is plenty of good stuff in life that you can have without having a relationship.If you are still wanting to find the right person, consider becoming more clear on your own values and what you want in a partner. Also, look at your own wants and fears. You can learn a lot about yourself by looking at these things. Once you are able to look at your fears and understand them, you can become stronger and know what is truly important to you. I suggest looking at other relationships in your life and seeing what you like about those relationships. It may also be helpful to go on a date with a friend. You can learn a lot about yourself and the other person on a date. We often do things we do not like because we think it will make us like something else. On a date, try to focus on the good aspects of the other person and not notice the negative things. Have fun!I encourage you to find out what you want and how you can be happy. It might take some time, but it will happen.I hope that you find what you are looking for!Robin J.

    "You are a counselor and your client approachs you with their concern.\nClient: I found out my boyfriend takes anti-depression medicine. Lately he's been saying he has a lot on his mind, and he needs time to think about us. We've only been dating 3 weeks but I like him a lot.\nYou:": {
        "PREDICTION": "Is there a specific reason why you and the boyfriend only have been dating three weeks?Is there a reason you would feel so strongly about someone in three weeks that you would want to continue dating them?Often, what people mean is that they like the boyfriend, but if there is no obvious problem in the couple, then it may be wise to give the two of you more time to see how compatible you two are.It may also be that the boyfriend is having a lot of thoughts about the relationship, because he himself doesn't know what to think.When a person is feeling sad or troubled, it is often difficult for them to talk about their feelings. The person may be shy to the point of not wanting to talk about how they feel, or the person may be expecting a response from the other person that they would like to hear. If you tell the boyfriend you're feeling hurt or puzzled by his recent behavior, it is possible he will feel that you're expecting him to give you a clear and immediate answer, and so will shy away from talking about himself. If you both continue dating, then it is important that you both have the ability to talk about what is on your mind, even if the answer is something that you disagree with.In the future, if you feel that you feel strongly enough about a person to want to see them as a boyfriend, then you can say something like, \"\"I really like you, but I'm not sure what we're doing. I feel hurt and I'd like to talk about it, but I'm not sure how to do that. What do you think?\"\"Also, it may be that the three weeks together so far are a reflection of the boyfriend's willingness to be open with you.In any case, it may be a good idea for the two of you to talk so that you both understand each other better, and that you each have an idea of what you expect from the other person.I hope this helps.

    "You are a counselor and your client approachs you with their concern.\nClient: I've worked with this guy for about three years now, and I knew the first time I saw him that I was attracted. Over time, he became a very dear friend, and we talked about our relationship problems, family, dreams, and so on. There was always flirtation with us, and one day pretty recently, it progressed to making out. We agreed to keep it quiet, and we did, but in the back of my mind, I hoped it would become something more. It didn't, and three months later, I'm still not over it. I'm trying so hard to maintain the friendship because that's what he wants. We're no longer in the same office, which I thought would help me get over these feelings, but we still talk about work, and he's constantly touching me, so I'm still very drawn to him. He's a hugger and such a sweet guy, so I find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be, but he's clearly not interested. He's younger than me and prefers model types, but I see him checking me out a lot, which gives me hope. How do I get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship?\nYou:": {
        "PREDICTION": "How you handle this situation is the most important thing. You say that you are trying to maintain the friendship because your colleague (your crush) wants you to. Are you going to give in to this pressure? What if you are able to say no. Maybe you could request to be sent to a different office. Or maybe you could not talk to him about this in a way that tells him you are receptive to his feelings. You need to be in control of this situation. You don't say how old you are but i would assume that you are an adult and you can do whatever you want. Your job and your crush's job is to respect you and what you want and if he is not willing to do that then you have every right to end this relationship. There is no magic pill for this, you need to figure out what is best for you. Best of luck!",

On the one hand you want to get over him, on the other you are still holding out hope for something more. It will be really hard to let go of him and create friend boundaries so long as there is a part of you holding on to the idea of something more. If you are being really honest with yourself you might need to acknowledge that you are not really striving to get him out of your system - that you have not really given up hope of having a relationship with him. If you are whole-heartedly committed to moving past the sexual and romantic parts of your relationship and just having a friendship than refraining from all the touching would be a good place to start. It is hard to \"\"just be friends\"\" when all your sex and bonding hormones are coursing through your veins.\""

    "You are a counselor and your client approachs you with their concern.\nClient: I am divorced and happily remarried. Our blended family of children are in their 20s. My youngest, age 20, continues to call me crazy and favors her dad. He was abusive to me, and I left with injuries. He never wanted kids, and I did. He paid child support only through forced wage earners. Now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices I made for them the past 15 years as a single mom. I don\u2019t deny them a relationship with their dad, but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core. I\u2019m not sure how to handle this.\nYou:": {
        "PREDICTION": "First off I want to say that it is okay to feel whatever it is that you are feeling. Many people don't feel that they are crazy because they are able to separate themselves and see that what the others are doing is different from them. It is normal to want the best for your kids and it is also normal to want to set boundaries for your kids and what is best for them. Parents in your situation may have different opinions of what is best for their children. In the end, kids are kids and they will do what they want to do. You are still their mom and they need you to be a mom. I am not sure if you have talked to your ex about what is going on with you or not, but maybe that is an option that you could talk to him about. I know that you have sacrificed a lot for your children and I am sure that they appreciate that. I am not sure what the outcome of this situation is, but I do know that you can still be a loving mom and set boundaries for them. You can help them have a relationship with their dad, but you can also make sure that it is on your terms and that you have control over how and when you interact with him. If you can keep yourself healthy and happy that could also help you to be a better parent to your kids. If you are not happy being called crazy, then perhaps you can send them a message that shows that you love them and you are a loving mom that is protecting their motherly instincts for them.I hope that you can make it through this difficult time. Maybe you can find some support from others in a local Mothers of Multiples group. Good luck!",
        "TARGET": "\"Hi Arkansas,\u00a0Your situation sounds like a case of parental alienation. Your ex-partner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you. It's a form of woman abuse and child abuse. He's likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you, and he's not considering how it's affecting the kids. I've seen this happen in many families; parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent. In some cases, children actually stop having contact with one parent, who is left bewildered and powerless. It's your ex's job to support your relationship with your kids, not try to destroy it.\u00a0While you can't change his behaviours, and I think you know that, there are things you can do for yourself and your kids.\u00a0For your children, you can refuse to enter into the war he's setting up. He's trying to provoke you into acting \"\"crazy\"\", but you don't have to fall for this. If you run around screaming \"\"he's lying!\"\", it only makes you look more 'crazy'. Try to stay calm, and don't put their dad down to them, no matter how tempting it is. One day, they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father, but wait until they ask. Trust that they have their own experience of their dad, and trust that he doesn't have the power to destroy their love for you. Children, in the long term, lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent. They see who their dad is already, I'd bet, but they don't know how to cope with that. If he's the only one fighting a war, you're helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict. Don't engage on his level.\u00a0Don't blame your children completely. Although I have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you don't need to tolerate that disrespect, try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it. They are acting out their father's agenda, likely because they instinctively see his weakness. Children often support the weaker parent, rather than abandon them. You get the worst because they trust your love. But you can still have boundaries. Letting them abuse you isn't the answer, but have compassion for their position. This picture isn't their fault, but as adults, they can be held accountable for their choices.Reassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are. You don't need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices. Hold onto the likelihood that some day, they will come back and be grateful. It may take a while, you can't rush it, but they will see you for who you are. Your power is in giving them a consistently calm, generous, connected, supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked on.\u00a0I'd recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon, or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded. Good luck!\""

I hope this helps. Best of luck to you.\"Cassandra\"Cassandra,I appreciate your question and I'm glad you are seeking some insight into why you find yourself feeling so sad. It is important to dig deep into why we feel sad, what we are missing and what it is that we are missing. The next step is to look for ways to find happiness again. This is where therapy comes in. It can be hard to start feeling happy again by ourselves. Sometimes we need to look at what is missing from our lives. For example, you said that you listen to sad music. What are you trying to achieve by listening to sad music? What is the feeling you are trying to achieve? Is that how you want to feel? Maybe you need to listen to happy music in order to feel happy. It all depends on your situation. I don't know you, but I see that there is something sad in your life, but I see something else as well. I see someone looking for happiness, but they may not know how to get there. It is a slow journey and you will have to make some mistakes along the way in order to learn.

        "TARGET": "It sounds like you are noticing that you are drawn towards sad and negative content and it's hard to understand why. This may sound counter-intuitive, but sometimes we do things that on the surface may look problematic (or even cause us some real problems) because it serves us in some unseen way. A simple example would be somebody who is addicted to a substance; their addiction may be causing serious problems in their life, and they may even know it, but the addiction serves them by helping them to avoid painful feelings that they anticipate having if they quit using. Now I am not saying that what you describe is an addiction, it is just a really illustrative example of the unseen benefit.One thing I would be wondering about is what is the unseen benefit of seeking out sad and negative content? I'd also be wondering what your relationship is to other feelings. These are things you may benefit from exploring with a competent therapist."

If you are a child or teenager, this is a normal time to have identity questions and to be in a phase where you are trying to figure out who you are and what you want out of life. I hope that you have understanding and supportive friends and family that you can talk to and who will support you in how you feel and what you may decide to do. A lot of people, unfortunately, do not, and if this is the case then it makes it harder for you. Because then you may not feel safe exploring these feelings and decisions.I urge you not to try to make any permanent changes for quite some time. By this I mean a sex change. Anything permanent like surgery or hormone replacement to change your actual gender is something that does not need to be done lightly. Please find a therapist that can help you explore your feelings and your identity crisis. Of course there are things that you can do that are not permanent changes. Many people decide to dress like their gender of choice. Maybe experimenting in this way is something that you could do.See if you have a local chapter of PFLAG in your area. PFLAG stands for Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. They are able to help not only with those who identify as lesbian or gay, but also transgendered and asexual.\u00a0I wish you all the best in your identity crisis.

That being said, it can be so frustrating and upsetting to have to contend with the anxious thoughts that come up in our heads, sometimes without any warning. Additionally, nighttime is a particularly vulnerable time for a lot of people wherein anxiety rears its' ugly head even more so. We aren't as distracted at night and our resources are more depleted so we can't fight back against these thoughts as effectively as usual.\u00a0It can be helpful to externalize our anxiety, give it a name, like \"\"Judy\"\" or \"\"Bill\"\" for example (or perhaps something more sinister like Lord Garmadon??). The naming is all up to you, what comes to mind for you when you think of your anxiety, now what is a name that's fitting? The act of externalizing separates us from the anxiety a bit and makes it a little more tolerable. If you can think of your anxiety as just something else to handle rather than it being a part of your personality, this is usually helpful.\u00a0Additionally, I recommend not avoiding the situations that make you feel this way. Our brains have to learn what is an actual threat and what is not. Right now, your brain thinks that crowds are a threat, if you can practice some deep breathing and stay in the crowd, you will start to teach (or rewire) your brain, letting it know that the crowd is not dangerous to you. Think of your brain as an overprotective parent. Your brain is overreacting in these situations to try and keep you safe. It just needs to learn that the situation is not a danger to begin with.\""
